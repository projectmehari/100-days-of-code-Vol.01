****Hackathon Goal Setting Workshop - Alec D'Alelio (Mochi)****

Everything in its right place (Book)

Token incentives & agile principles are the principles at Mochi

Goal theory: The act of charting measurable steps to propel you toward a desired outcome over a predetermined period of time.

Journey: a period of time during which one tracks their progress on a goal with a team of 2-4 people. We recommend 8 weeks. All hackathon participants are invited to join a Mochi! Journey to take your hackathon projects to the next level and stay accountable to your goals.

Pearl of wisdom (Proof of work): a daily check-in or progress update on your goal.
