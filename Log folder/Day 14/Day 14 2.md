****unun. ðŸ›  Building our own music and multimedia platform**** 

- Sofja & Astrosuka
- **Unun**: Small mutable metlabel for hybrid music & multimedia releases a platform that adapts itself to our artistic needs, not the other way around an excuse to collaborate with friends from local scenes, learn new shit and build an autonomous + self sustaining space for experiments.
- The platform being an extension of our identity.
- Networks that can talk to each other because they speak the same language, use the same protocol and keep your identity.

Question: What is the difference between IPFS and arweave?

**Website** : Editor.p5js.org

**************Process**************

** NFT.storage

1. Make music
2. Upload it to IPFS
3. Generate multiple artworks and metadata in p5.js
4. Upload images to IPFS
5. Replace url in metadata
6. Upload json files to IPFS
7. Deploy contract with zora starter kit by tranqui.eth

URI base + Contract uri

1. Download and install unin repository
2. git clone: https://github.com/ununlink/unun.git
3. cd into directory
4. open with code
5. npm install
6. npm run dev

Copy/paste contract address into website and adjust mint price contract address en mint.tsx y en gallery.tsx

mint first piece to try

push to github and publish

### Notes

Spores - A deep dive into spores (Alec Resende)

Spores is a new way to remix culture, as you experience it.

- Using a spore, you can listen to songs across web3, and remix them.
- After listening, a recording is produced: a new remix
- This new shared history is preserved on-chain
- But what exactly is happening here?

The Spores Ecosystem

Provenance

1. Remixer signature
2. Collection address
3. Token ID

**AKA** what was remixed & who remixed it?

Storing provenance

- Remixerâ€™s address
- collection address
- Token ID
- IPFS CID of the remix mp3

HTML NFTs

**What are they?**

- Encapsulated website with no backend
- Hosted on decentralized storage (IPFS or arweave)
- Displayed on marketplacces (like Zora) as IFRAME.

What can they do?

- Generative art
- Realtime interactive
- Utilize powerful web APIs like web audio (music) and WebGL (graphics)

Examples of HTML NFTâ€™s

- Sabotage by Kim Asendorf
- Hepta by Tero Parviainen
- Solvency by Ezra Miller

### Spores kit

Add a programmable Spore to your site, to play with

Grab it at : https://github.com/universalsequences/spores-kit

**Idea:** Create a json containing the main song, alternate song, and juice samples. Store this json on IPFS and you a new format for bundling 2 songs w/ loops that work with it.
