Notes

---

** Took today off to prepare my trip to artbasel, only did some research on Artiva

****Artiva ðŸ›  Artivaâ€™s path to decentralization - Neokry****

What is Artiva currently?

- No code NFT platform builder
- bundles other NFT tools
- Users can exit without losing their market or assets
- Very easy to set up

**Current issues**

- We have full control of the api/databas
- Product is closed source
- Users are not owners of Artiva
-

How can solve this issues?

## Case study with Mirror

All content is published to Arweave

- Cheap for users to publish
- Network effects building on an open system
- Exit with post data
- very easy to get started

Publication data is off-chain

- Recreating the mirror client
- Builders cannon use publication groupings/metadata
- Likely a limitation of only using arweave

### How does Artiva compare to Mirror

Required are similar

- Users should be able to easily/cheaply add content
- Content should be publised on a open system

Artiva needs open platform level data

- L2s are production ready
- Necessary for self hosting/hosted services
- Client innovation
- On chain publishing modules

### Why build a publishing protocol?

Content and metadata will always be accessible and uncensorable

- Self hosting/hosted services
- Exit clients with a full platform metadata, content and roles.
- Open sources clients
- Utilize the data in unique ways:
- 1) Stronger social graphs between users, nfts
- 2)Clients for unique content types, platform discovery etc

### On chain data lends to unique innovations

Publishing modules

- Token gated publishing
- Snapshot publishing via merkle trees
- Prop house publishing

Unique clients

- NFT explorer to discover and curate new content
- Platformn explorer/curator
- In depth designers

Does every user have to pay gas fee to put content on a platform?

- Hosted services can use metatransacttions
- Users will sign content with a non economic device key (similar to Mirror)

Wonâ€™t that be expensive for hosted services?

- Contracts on L2
- Content lives on arweave etc, only content URIs are stored on chain.

**Interaction with the protocol**

### An overview of the new client

- **All data is sourced from the contract via indexers and content is pulled from arweave**
- **Open source**
1. Remixable
2. Self hosting
3. Hosted services
- **Modular**
1. Themes change the look and feel of the client without having to modify the source code
2. Adaptors can support many NFT marketplaces, rendering strategies and data sources

Sustainable protocol / Client development

- Auction protocol provenance via NFTs nouns style
- DAO funds proposals that benefit the protocol ecoystem ( Clients, publishers, themes, marketing)
