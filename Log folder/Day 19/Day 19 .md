Decentralized identity:  System of identity management for people, organizations, and more operating on decentralized ledger technology, like blockchain

Self-Sovereign Identity: Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a framework for digital identities that restores power back to the individual to control and gatekeep access to their digital identity and the information contained within their ID.

Hyperstructures: Crypto protocols that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption or intermerdiaries.

### Refugees Lack ID

### Relief Orgs try closing the ID gap with DID

![Screen Shot 2022-12-05 at 3.11.09 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-05_at_3.11.09_PM.png)

- Decentralized Identity (DID) = an ID management system operating on the blockchain

Few UN iniatiaves utilize blockchain tech: PRIMES and Building Blocks problems?

- Storing personal information and biometric data on a centralized storage system
- Biometrics = invasive

### Self Sovereign Identity

A Self-Sovereign Identity is this portable, private and secure.

SS1 are user-centric and user-owned:

- Each user owns his own and does not rely on a central entity to prove claims about himself

SS1 allow for Consent and Control

- Each user has full control and consent on what personal information he is sharing and with whom.
- SS1 are interoperable: Self-Sovereign Identity uses a common identity metasystem. This allows users to verify their identity across multiple platforms and locations (that use the same metasystem)

Consider: Self-Sovereign Identity Registry a Hyperstructures?

![Screen Shot 2022-12-05 at 3.23.15 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-05_at_3.23.15_PM.png)

Hyperstructure - Crypto protocols that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption or intermediaries.

- Hyperstructures are transparent, unstoppable, free, permissionless, decentralized, credibly-neutral (free of politics).

Internationally recognized SS1 system = effective coordination at local, national and international level

Globally integrated, user-owner ID system

### Concluding thoughts

![Screen Shot 2022-12-05 at 3.26.08 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-05_at_3.26.08_PM.png)

There is a need for impact-driven solutions to problems the most marginalized andd vulnerable in our society continue to face.

Self-Sovereign Identity systems operating on the blockchain can hedge against political turmoil and enable a refugee to maintain power and dignity of proven identity.

Blockchain is an opportunity to protect the identity of refugees and provide ownership of their credentials.

## Chapter 1 - What are UI and UX design

**Understand the differences between User Interface (UI) design and User Experience (UX) design.**

What is user interface (UI) Design?

- A user interface is the interface through which a user interacts with a device. For example, on a mobile phone, the user interface is what is displayed on the screen of the device.

The [Macintosh](https://www.mac-history.net/computer-history/2008-05-25/apple-macintosh) was soon to follow in 1984, with a refined core design language including iconography and typefaces designed by [Susan Kare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Kare).

What is User Experience (UX) Design?

- *User experience (UX)* describes the entire experience around a product or service, taking into account the user’s emotional state, the context or environment, and the designed system or artifact.

![Screen Shot 2022-12-05 at 7.51.56 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-05_at_7.51.56_PM.png)

Today, user experience (UX) is at the center of our assessment of systems and interfaces, focused on designing for pleasure rather than the absence of pain.

> *Five phases of evolution of evaluation in human-computer interaction (HCI) defined by [Jofish Kaye and Phoebe Sengers](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Evolution-of-Evaluation-Kaye-Sengers/e09bfb9c4ceab4dedbfd6a28a5693efdedddd21a), as summarized by [Craig MacDonald and Michael Atwood](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262244405_Changing_perspectives_on_evaluation_in_HCI_past_present_and_future).*
> 

User experience (UX) design is a human-centered design discipline that addresses the holistic experience of a product, focused on:

- **User journey:** The entire process surronding use of a product, from the problem to be solved through the impact of the solution
- **User research:** Qualitative and quantitative research to put the user at the center of the design process.
- **Deliverables** to document the user experience and define the workflows and features of a product or design, such as:
- **Personas**: Summaries of example and target users, generally based on a composite of user research.
- **Journey maps:** A timeline of user actions related to accomplishing a particular goal related to a product or design.
- **Storyboards:** A sequence of panels (often resembling a comic book) depicting a user story chronologically.
- **Prototypes**: iterative models, sketches or wireframes of a design used to gather feedback and inform the final design.

**How it fits together: five elements of UX design**

![Screen Shot 2022-12-05 at 7.59.12 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-05_at_7.59.12_PM.png)

**************The five elements of UX design, from Jesse James Garrett’s “The elements of User Experience.*************

1. **Strategy:** What problems is this product intended to solve? This layer, the most abstract of the model, takes into consideration both user needs and business goals.
2. **Scope:** What is the product that will be created to solve the problem? Within this layer, the team defines functional requirements ( what features to build) and content requirements (written and visual information to include)
3. **Structure**: How is the design organized and how do interactions work? This layer includes information architecture (the structure and organization of content) and interaction design ( the interactive experience of the product).
4. **Skeleton**: How is information presented and arranged? This layer begins to consider interface design (design of interface elements), navigation design, (how users move through a system), and information design (presenting information to facilitate understanding). A common output at this stage is a set of wireframes.
5. **Surface**: How does the product look and feel to users? This stage emphasizes visual design, for example, what colors and typefaces are used, and is the stage where UI design is front and center ( though it is not exclusive to the surface).

### **Who are the user and end-user?**

The user refers broadly to anyone who may use or maintain the product, and could include people such as system administrators, IT experts, and computer technicians. In early computing, these were often the only people using computing systems, since they required technical knowledge to operate.

In today’s landscape, it’s useful to differentiate between the user and the end-user: the person intended to ultimately use the product, who may not have the technical know-how or skill of the product’s administrators.

## UI and UX Methodologies

Design theory and practice are constantly evolving. New methodologies and principles are defined constantly within design — for example, design justice and Microsoft’s inclusive design emphasize diversity, equity, and inclusion.

**The double diamond model**

- The double diamond is a broadly applicable process model for a cross-functional, iterative design or innovation.
- This methodology was [formalized by the British Design Council](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-work/news-opinion/double-diamond-universally-accepted-depiction-design-process/) in 2005 through an in-depth study of 11 global brands, including LEGO, Microsoft, Sony, and Starbucks.

![Screen Shot 2022-12-05 at 8.22.16 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-05_at_8.22.16_PM.png)

The two-diamond structure of the diagram illustrates two modes of thinking that occur during the strategy and execution stages of the design process. ***Divergent thinking*** explores many possible solutions and generates novel ideas. ***Convergent thinking*** analyzes, filters, and focuses ideas and leads to decisions.

A well-executed double diamond process ensures that product requirements and subsequent design work are focused on user needs.

The four phases of the double diamond process are as follows:

- **Discover** (Divergent strategy): Explore the problem and landscape, and learn from users and the market through user interviews, surveys, and other research.
- **Define** (convergent strategy): Sort of analyze the information gathered during the discovery stage and hone in on the problem we’re trying to solve.
- **Develop** (divergent execution): Generate a range of ideas for possible solutions through brainstorms, workshops, low fidelity prototypes, and other ideation methods. Test different ideas with users or within the company to see what resonates.
- **Deliver** (Convergent execution): Hone in on, develop, and deliver the solution. Continue evaluating and testing the developed design to ensure it meets user needs.

### The product development life cycle

![Screen Shot 2022-12-05 at 8.36.12 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-05_at_8.36.12_PM.png)

Today’s UI and UX designers don’t just think about visual design: they are problem solvers involved in every stage of the product development process. The product development Life cycle helps us understand how design fits into product development.

The **product development life cycle** (PDLC) is a cross-functional, iterative process, usually involving many stakeholders across an organization.

The process starts from a problem or pain to ensure that product development meets a real user need and that the whole team is aligned the same goals.

The product development life cycle consists of 5 stages:

- **Brainstorm:** Starting from a defined problem or pain point, the team brainstorms all possible solutions. Market or user research can help inspire ideas.
- **Define:** The team aligns on specifications for the product by defining the vision, goals, target users, features, benefits, and success metrics.
- **Design:** The product is designed from low-fidelity to high-fidelity, starting with sketches and wireframes and moving to prototypes and a completed interface.
- **Test:** the product or prototype is tested to ensure it works as intented. Testing can range from informal internal testing of low fidelity prototypes to usability testing of a high-fidelity prototype or final product by external users.
- **Launch**: The final design is released to the public, but the cycle doesn’t end here. Typically, testing continues even after the product has launched, and the cycle continues.

### Design thinking

The term wicked problems was coined by design theorist Horst Rittel to describe the types of extremely complex, multi-dimensional problems that designers are often tasked to solve. Design thinking isn’t limited to creating new products — it can affect change at a systemic level.

*Design thinking* as a formal methodology has [developed across multiple disciplines since the 1960s](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/design-thinking-get-a-quick-overview-of-the-history), and is commonly associated with the design and consulting firm [IDEO](https://designthinking.ideo.com/) and the Stanford School of Design (the [d.school](https://dschool.stanford.edu/)).

![Screen Shot 2022-12-05 at 8.58.58 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-05_at_8.58.58_PM.png)

Design thinking puts people at the center of every process and encourages designers to set aside assumptions.

Like the double diamond model, design thinking offers opportunities to focus on both divergent and convergent thinking across its steps to encourage both creativity and problem solving.

Design thinking lives at the intersection of desirability (people), viability (business), and feasibility (technology).

Design thinking’s core activities are inspiration, ideation, and implementation, which occur across the five stages of the process:

- **Empathize**: Understand the user and the landscape
- **Define**: Define the problem and align with business goals and user needs.
- **Ideate**: Generate a range of ideas for possible solutions, emphasizing creativity.
- **Prototype**: Explore potential solutions by creating prototype of the product to gather feedback.
- **Test**: Test the best solutions developed during prototyping. Prototyping or testing may lead to redefining the problem altogether. As with the other processes we’ve covered, this is an iterative cycle.

### User-Centered design

User-centered design (UCD) puts users at the center of product development and involves them in the design from the beginning. 

Here, design is seen as an iterative process that incorporates user feedback both during the development process and after launch. User-centered design responds to both contexts of use (such as the user’s environment, technology, ,and emotional state) and business goals.

User-centered design responds to both contexts of use (such as the user’s environment, technology, and emotional state) and business goals.

UX and UI design as disciplines are user-centered, and associated methodologies generally fall under the umbrella of user-centered design.

While user-centered design processes may define the steps differently, they generally involve the following activities:

1. **Understand**: Empathize
2. **Specify**: Hone in on a specific problem to solve.
3. **Design**: Brainstorm and develop solutions
4. **Evaluate**: Test the product or prototypes to assess success and incorporate feedback

## Defining “Good” UX

The methodologies we’ve described so far ensure that teams are aligned and that user needs are at the center of the process, but what defines a “good” user experience? What makes a product or design truly great?

- **Useful**: fulfills a user’s needs
- **Usable**: easy to use and understand
- **Desirable**: visually attractive and succinct
- **Findable**: easy to navigate and find information
- **Accessible**: Users with disabilities can use the product

Google takes a condensed approach to defining the characteristics of a good user experience:

- **Usable**: easy to find and use functionality
- **Equitable**: Benefiting individuals across skills and backgrounds
- **Enjoyable**: pleasing to use beyond basic funtionality
- **Useful:** solves a user need

### The 10 usability heuristics

Jakob Nielsen, co-founder of the Nielsen Norman Group, devised a set of ten usability heuristics as a set of general principles for good interaction design.

They help designers assess where a design is excelling and falling short, and what trade-offs are being made in a design process.

1. **Visibility of system status**: The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.
2. **Consistency and standards**: users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.
3. **Flexibility and efficiency of use**: Shortcuts, hidden from novice users, may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
4. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**: Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

The heuristic evaluation is a relatively quick and flexible method of usability testing, compared to mother methods such as user testing. During this process, a group of expert evaluators. expertise and it not a replacement for testing a product with real users.

Nielsen’s heuristics have inspired others to create alternate heuristic for assessment within different fields, such as [humane design](https://designlab.com/blog/heuristics-humane-design-designing-for-dignity/) and [persuasive health technologies](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~choe/download/IHI-10-Kientz.pdf).

### Introduction to UX research

*User research* is the systematic study of target users of a product or interface to understand their behaviours, needs, and motivations.

User research can happen at every stage of the design process to inform decisions. Others specialize in *qualitative research* methods that examine why users behave the way they do in depth, such as interviews, focus groups, and ethnography.

Anthropologist [Margaret Mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead) once said, “What people say, what people do, and what people say they do are entirely different things.”

![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 10.21.19 AM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-06_at_10.21.19_AM.png)

**Attitudinal methods** focus on what users say, through user interviews, surveys, and diary studies.

Behavioural methods observe user behavior, through ethnographic studies, A/B testing, and user testing.

Evaluation methods like user testing and A/B testing assess how a design or prototype performs once its complete.

A skilled user researcher is able to tell stories and frame their research in digestible ways that are useful and compelling for others within the organization. Tools like *[personas](https://www.codecademy.com/article/ui-design-personas)*, *[user journey maps](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/journey-mapping-101/)*, and *[storyboards](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/storyboards-visualize-ideas/)* can be used to advocate for the user and circulate key points from user research across an organization.

### The UI and UX career landscape

**Generalists vs Specialists**

Within the UI and UX design field, generalists focus on a broad range of work across multiple stages of the design process, while specialists focus on one more or a few areas within the broader fields of UI and UX design. 

![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 10.30.22 AM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-06_at_10.30.22_AM.png)

**UX designer:** This role focuses on the holistic experience of a product or service from start to finish, including both UI and UX. These versatile designers are as likely to be found talking to users and conducting reseach as focusing for hours creating a pixel-perfect high fidelity design.

![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 10.33.03 AM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-06_at_10.33.03_AM.png)

A day in the life of a UX designer may include:

- Creating wireframes for an upcoming web launch
- Creating high-fidelity digital prototypes of a design
- Working on an onboarding flow for a mobile application
- Interviewing users
- Developing [user personas](https://www.codecademy.com/article/ui-design-personas)

## Specialists within UI and UX design

**UI Designer**: Designing Pixel-Perfect Visual interfaces. *UI designers* are focused on the design of user interfaces, or what will appear on the screen through which a user interacts with a device.

A day in the life of a UI designer may include:

- Creating high-fidelity digital prototypes of a design
- Deciding on a color palette for a mobile app
- Creating a visual style guide for a new sub-brand
- Checking the accessibility of a design
- Communicating with developers about technical design requirements

****UX Researcher: Studying Users, Uncovering Insights****

*UX researchers*(or *user researchers*) bring a wide toolkit of research tools to the study of users and advocate for user needs across the organization.

A day in the life of a user researcher may include:

- Interviewing users
- Creating a survey to send to customers
- Analyzing research data
- Presenting research results to the rest of the team
- Developing [user personas](https://www.codecademy.com/article/ui-design-personas), [journey maps](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/journey-mapping-101/), or [storyboards](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/storyboards-visualize-ideas/)

More specialist roles in UX:

1. **Information architect**: Information architects focus how information is structured and how users navigate a product. This role may perform content audits, create site maps, and use techniques like [card sorting](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/card-sorting-definition/) and [tree testing](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tree-testing/).
2. **Interaction designer**: Interaction designers focus on the interactive aspects of a design, for example, how does the interface give feedback to a user after an action? How long should an animation within an interface be? What sound should the interface make when there’s an error?
3. **Usability tester**: Usability testing is part of evaluative research, which occurs after a design or prototype is completed. Usability testers determine pain points within a product and suggest improvements.
4. **UX writer**: UX writers focus specifically on product copy, for example, error messages, the microcopy that appears on a button, or the onboarding copy for an application.

### Hybrid roles in UX

In addition to specialist roles that fall cleanly under the “UX design” umbrella, there are specialist roles that hybridize UX and another field or skillset. People from almost any background can bring a unique perspective to UX and may stay in hybrid roles permanently, or leapfrog their way to other UX roles. Hybrid roles can also be a way for UX professionals to broaden their skillsets.

## Information architecture

*Information architecture* is the organization, prioritization, and presentation of information within products, websites, and other software applications. Effective information architecture is important because it allows users to complete tasks with the least effort required. We can visually represent this information using a *site map.*

A *site map* is a high-level view representing content hierarchy within a digital interface. Site maps define all pages that need to be built. We have included a site map that features an assortment of tiered blocks interconnected with lines.

The homepage in this example is at the top of the site map and encompasses the catalog, resources, and community pages. Challenges, articles, videos, and projects are sub-pages under the resources page. Navigational paths throughout the pages are called *user workflows.*

![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 10.41.51 AM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-06_at_10.41.51_AM.png)

*User workflows* illustrate the path a user takes to complete a task. In this site map, a path from homepage -> resources -> projects is considered a user workflow

### What us a wireframe

![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 10.43.14 AM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-06_at_10.43.14_AM.png)

- One of the first steps toward designing a digital interface is to create *wireframes.*
- A wireframes is a low-fidelity representation of a digital interface.
- Wireframes are low-fidelity because there are no interactive features and they are created using low-fidelity elements.

Focus on building an intuitive layout that meets our three main requirements:

1. User needs
2. Stakeholder goals
3. Technical capabilities

Sketching is used to create quick concepts and to iterate ideas using pen and paper. Wireframes are made with digital tools and are low-fidelity representations of digital interfaces.

Wireframing occurs in the early design stage and is a cross-functional, iterative process, usually involving many stakeholders across an organization.

The process starts from a *problem* or *pain point* to ensure that product development meets a real user need and that the whole team is aligned around the same goals.

## Why do we need to wireframe?

Our goal is to establish the content layout prior to high-fidelity design and software development. Establishing content layout helps prevent costly rework downstream.

Sketching is bundled into the wireframing process as well, and this exercise helps us rapidly iterate and produce solutions, all in a low-risk environment.

![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 10.50.01 AM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-06_at_10.50.01_AM.png)

In the scope of product development, wireframes are one of the first polished deliverables that can accurately portray the final product’s structure. Wireframes are an excellent resource for designers, developers, and stakeholders to understand how the interface is configured and how the wireframe meets our design requirements.

Wireframing serves as an efficient solution towards establishing page layouts that support user needs, stakeholder goals, and technical capabilities.

![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 10.54.32 AM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-06_at_10.54.32_AM.png)

Wireframe elements can be represented in many different ways. Common representations include, but are not limited to:

- **Logos**: A rectangle labeled as “logo”
- **Navigation**: a rectangle contained navigation links (i.e “home”, “about us”, “services”, etc)
- **Search fields**: A rectangle labeled “search”, sometimes featuring a magnifying glass.
- **Text**:  A rectangle labeled “text field”.
- **Images**: A box labeled “image” with diagonal lines between opposing corners.
- **Videos**: A box labeled “video” with diagonal lines between opposing corners and a circle centered in the box contained a video play arrow.

### How do we make a wireframes?

Effective user research:

- User goals and tasks for the application
- User pain points, behaviors, and desires
- Current workflows used to complete these tasks.

The location of page elements should provide a solution to our design requirements. It is recommended to prioritize valuable information in an “easy-to-reach” place based on content hierarchy.

Navigation bar houses an interface’s most important navigational elements:

- Logo
- Button login
- Navigation menu

Below the navigation bar is often the following elements:

- Image
- Header
- Input, email
- Input, password
- Button, sign up

A *prototype* builds upon the structural layout through the integration of higher-fidelity design elements and interactivity. **Prototypes** allow hands-on interaction and validation through user testing. User testing is an excellent method to garner feedback to enhance usability during product development.

### Intro to Figma

Tool description

The **main menu**, which has the Figma “F” icon, includes a dropdown menu with options for managing the design file.

The **move tool** (V) , which has an icon that looks like a cursor, allows us to select and move objects around on the canvas.

The **frame tool** (F) allows us to add a frame to the canvas. We can choose from preset frames listed in the right sidebar, or we can create a custom frame by selecting the frame tool and dragging a frame to the desired dimensions.

The **shapes tool** allows us to add standard shapes to the canvas, such as rectangles, ellipses, and polygons. Images can also be added from the shapes tool.

The **pen tool** (P) allows us to draw out custom shapes.

The **text tool** (T) allows us to add text. Select the text tool, then select an area on the canvas and begin typing.

The **hand tool** (H) allows us to navigate around the canvas without selecting or moving any objects.

The **comments tool**(C) allows us to add a comment. Select a frame, object, or area on the canvas. Then, type the comment. Once the comment is added, anyone who opens the file will be able to see it.

### Layer panel

The **layers panel** is located on the left side of the editor. It shows a dynamic list of everything that is currently on the canvas. This list is divided into frames and layers. If a layer is on the canvas, but not in a frame, it will be listed on its own. If a layer is inside a frame, it will be listed beneath that frame.

To transform a design into a prototype, we need to add connections between frames. A **connection** has three elements: a hotspot, a connection, and a destination.

To create a **hotspot** (starting point), select a frame or a specific layer. When deciding where to place the hotspot, consider how someone might interact with the product. In the example design, someone would tap the “Sign Up” button to reach the next page, so this is a good place to add a hotspot.

With the hotspot selected, we can select the **connection node** (the plus sign on the right of the hotspot) and drag a connection to the destination frame.

### Introduction to Understanding the User

![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 12.18.57 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-06_at_12.18.57_PM.png)

Well-executed user research helps designers see past our assumptions and find creative solutions. In many, you’ll be designing products for users who are different from yourself. Even if you are among your product’s intended users, user research can help broaden your perspective.

Design methodologies like [design thinking](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-thinking), [user-centered design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-centered-design), the [double diamond diagram](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/double-diamond-diagram)
, and the [product development life cycle](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/product-development-life-cycle)
 may have different terms for the discovery phase of the design process, but they all emphasize understanding and empathizing with the user.

Engaging in user research helps designers and compagnies:

- Develop products people actually need
- Learn what users care about and what motivates them.
- Find gaps and pain points in the market or competitive landscape.
- Define exactly which problems to solve
- Hone in on target users to determine who is most likely to benefit from a solution.
- Decide whether a product idea is actually adding anything useful.

### Generative User Research

![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 12.23.44 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-06_at_12.23.44_PM.png)

Generative user research, also known as exploratory, discovery, or foundational research, occurs during the earlier stages of product development and focuses on discovering the motivations and pain points experienced by users. 

Some types of generatie user research include:

- Interviews
- Surveys
- Diary studies
- Ethnography and field studies

### Defining the problem space

Early-stage user research is also about figuring out exactly which problem needs to be solved.

![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 3.13.43 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-06_at_3.13.43_PM.png)

When selecting a topic for user research, consider the following:

- What are you trying to learn?
- What is your focused research goal?
- What are some research question(s) to help achieve your goal?
- Which research method(s) will help answer your research question(s)? (More on this later.)
- Who do you want to study or include in your research? (More on this later.)

The results of your research can help you identify a real problem, develop a solution that is actually useful, and deliver it to the right audience.

In planning your research, consider what stage you are at in the design process through a methodology like the [double diamond diagram](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/double-diamond-diagram). During the convergent strategy phase of this methodology, broader generative research is analyzed and the team moves forward toward problem definition.

As we walk through more research methods in this lesson, consider how we might eventually move from [divergent thinking](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/divergent-thinking) to [convergent thinking](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/convergent-thinking) about the problem to be solved, and which methods would best help define the problem for a given research project.

### Quantitative Research

*Quantitative research* methods are those that collect numerically measurable data. These methods allow UX professionals to discover broad patterns, compare different designs and their trade-offs, and tie their work back to company goals and [key performance indicators (KPIs)](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/kpi-meaning/).

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

Compared to qualitative research, which we’ll cover in the next exercise, quantitative research generally provides high level data about a larger number of participants.

**Surveys or questionnaires:** A broad range of users are sent the same set of questions to collect broad insights and trends about a given topic or market.

**Card sorting**: Participants organize topics into groups to help uncover an information architecture that aligns with users’ mental models.

**Web analytics:** Web analytics, including A/B testing and heat maps, are usually used in the later evaluative stages of user research but can also feed into discovery in an iterative design process.

### Qualitative Research

*Qualitative research* methods examine why users behave the way they do in depth, and focus on the motivations and thought processes behind a user’s experience.

- **Interviews**: A researcher asks each participant a structured, unstructured, or semi-structured series of questions about a topic.
- **Focus groups**: A researcher guides a group of 3-10 participants through a series of questions about topic, product, or design.
- **Diary studies**: Longitudinal qualitative data is collected from participants by asking them to complete entries in a diary which may include a series of prompts.
- **Ethnography and field studies**: These methods observe user behavior in a natural setting and often occur over time, offering more long-term or continuous insight into participant behavior.
- **Contextual inquiry**: Researchers conduct an interview in context as participants complete tasks.

### Working with mixed methods

![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 3.34.45 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-06_at_3.34.45_PM.png)

Good user research works with a mixture of methods to collect insights about both the bigger picture and the details. While some designers or researchers eventually specialize in particular methods, you’ll still want to be familiar with a mixture of [qualitative](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/qualitative-research), [quantitative](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/quantitative-research), [behavioral](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/behavioral-research)
, and [attitudinal](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/attitudinal-research) research methods.

Combining qualitative methods with quantitative methods can help explain why users are behaving in a particular way.

Attitudinal research methods focus on self-reported thoughts, beliefs, and needs from users, or put simply, what users say, rather than what they do:

- Interviews
- Focus groups
- Diary studies
- Surveys

Behavioral research methods, on the other hand, directly observe user behavior:

- Ethnography and field studies
- Web analytics
- Tree testing
- User testing

Mixing research methods doesn’t just apply to collecting your research data, but also how you might analyze it. Sometimes this is referred to as [triangulation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/triangulation-better-research-results-using-multiple-ux-methods/), “the practice of using multiple sources of data or multiple approaches to analyzing data, to enhance the credibility of a research study.”

### Creating  a Research Plan

This should includes:

- **Background**: Why are you embarking on this research?
- **Research goal**: What are you hoping to uncover with the research
- **Research questions**: What question or questions will help you achieve your research goal?
- **Research method(s) and protocols**:What research method or methods will you use? How will you specifically execute them? For example, if you’re conducting interviews, consider how many interviews you’d like to conduct, whether you’ll conduct them in-person or remotely, the target duration of the interviews, and how you’ll structure them.

**Target participants**: Who would you ideally like to talk to or include in your research?

- Do you have existing customers you can reach out to? Is it better if you speak with people unfamiliar with your product? Or a mix of both?
- What demographics are you hoping to reach?
- Is there anywhere that they gather online that you can recruit them?

In many cases, you will create a participant screener, a short survey or to qualify participants.

**Recruitment strategies:**

Where will you seek out participants? For example, you might consider using an existing customer list or reaching out in online communities.

Consider whether you will offer any compensation or incentives to participants. Be upfront with participants about time and effort required and how they will be compensated.

**Timeline and due dates:**

How long will each stage of the research take and when do you expect the project to be completed? A realistic timeline and scope will help you set appropriate expectations and plan your work.

**Any ethical considerations:**

How will you protect your participants and what can you realistically promise to them?

Consider *[informed consent](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-research-ethics/)*, and let participants know ahead of participation what risks the research may entail and how their contributions will be used.

**Research materials to be created:**

Think about what research, recruitment, and reporting collateral your team will need to create. This could include any informed consent forms or explanatory materials, interview scripts, survey questions, or anything else you might want to create in advance.

## ****Considering Diversity and Inclusion****

### **Accessibility:**

*[Accessibility](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/accessibility)* refers to designing devices, products, and environments such that individuals with disabilities or sensory impairments can successfully use them. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) break down accessibility into [four main principles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/): perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.

### Inclusive Design

*[Inclusive design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/inclusive-design)* is a discipline of design that emphasizes designing products and services that work for people of all demographics, perspectives, and abilities, with a focus on those who may have been historically marginalized or excluded.

**Universal Design:**

*[Universal design](https://projects.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/about_ud/udprinciplestext.htm)* focuses on creating one experience that can include as many people as possible. The principles of universal design consider how designs can be useful to people of diverse abilities, or adapt flexibly to users of different preferences and abilities.

**User-Centered Design (UCD):**

*[User-centered design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-centered-design)* is a design methodology consisting of an iterative process that puts users at the center of product development and involves them in the design from the beginning. UCD processes generally involve the following activities: understand, specify, design, and evaluate.

- **[Design justice](https://designjustice.org/read-the-principles)**: This approach “rethinks design processes, centers people who are normally marginalized by design, and uses collaborative, creative practices to address the deepest challenges our communities face.”
- **[Value-sensitive design](https://uxdesign.cc/human-values-matter-why-value-sensitive-design-should-be-part-of-every-ux-designers-toolkit-e53ffe7ec436)**: This approach to design aims to center human values and ethics in the design process and acknowledges the potential trade-offs and potential unintentional results tied to our design choices.
- **[Participatory design](https://uxmag.com/articles/participatory-design-in-practice)**: Also known as *co-design*, this design approach aims to involve users or stakeholders in actively designing solutions for themselves.

### Sharing your research

Part of your responsibility is to advocate for the user and share research findings across your organization.

Once you’ve analyzed your research, you’re ready to share it in a research report of your findings and recommendations.

Sharing your research is a process of storytelling.You can apply a design mindset to your research report and your methods for sharing your findings: think about the audience you’re presenting to and what kind of format and messaging is likely to resonate with them.

- Personas
- User journey maps
- Storyboards

**How to conduct User Interviews**

Learn how to prepare for and conduct successful user interviews.

As designers, we often think of target audiences as groups and users as average members of these groups. But within these audiences, individual users have unique thoughts, feelings, and ideas. So how do we gain insight into some of this personal feedback?

### What is a User Interview?

**User interviews** are a UX research method where a researcher conducts interviews with individual participants. User interviews are used to better understand what a given user thinks about a design, process, or product.

User interviews can be used in many different design stages. They can be conducted at the beginning of the design process - to develop more accurate personas or journey maps. Or maybe, after an initial mockup is created - to learn more about the perceptions and feelings toward a design.

The ability of user interviews to be effective in many different phases of the design process allows it to be a useful tool for practically any project or product. But regardless of the phase it is being used in, to conduct an effective user interview you first need to define a clear and concrete goal.

### Types of user interviews

There are three types of user interviews: **unstructured**, **semi-structured**, and **structured.**

![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 4.43.00 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-06_at_4.43.00_PM.png)

**Unstructured interviews** are defined by a few open-ended questions. There isn’t a specific outline to guide you - rather, the user’s responses lead the way. This format allows the conversation to flow naturally, putting the user more at ease, and you might uncover topics you wouldn’t have thought of prior to the interview.

**Semi-structured interview**  allow the researcher to adapt the interview based on the participant, but also have a general plan or outline that is created prior to the interview to lead the conversation towards a certain goal. The researcher will develop a series of questions and topics that will remain constant across participants, but then also leave time for follow-up questions that arise naturally based on different responses.

The researcher might also probe the user to complete certain interactions and then ask further questions about their thought process while completing the tasks.

**Structured interviews** have a very clear agenda and outline that is defined prior to the interview. Every participant is asked the same questions and follow-up questions - regardless of their answers. This method does allow the researcher to control the types of insight they will receive, as well as limit the overall bias. This method will produce the most controlled, reliable qualitative data.

### Planning your research

Before we can conduct our user interview, we first need to develop a research plan. Writing a research plan is vital to ensure your user research is well-oriented and the research goal is clearly communicated to your team.

You can download the [Research Plan Template](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPfqUgFo=/?share_link_id=791482474287) to follow along with the process of writing out a research plan for your first user interview!

### Defining a goal

An established, concrete **research goal** related to specific aspects of user behaviors or perspectives can help you develop relevant interview questions and lead the interview more effectively.

To develop a goal, answer the following questions:

- What stage of the design process are you at?
- What are you hoping to learn about from the interview?
- What questions do stakeholders have?
- Do you have a mockup or prototype that you want the user to give feedback on?

### Prepare for a user interview

After defining a goal and choosing which type of interview you will conduct, you will want to do some prep work. Before conducting the interview, you need to recruit your participants, prepare a discussion guide, write interview questions, and set up the interview environment.

### Recruiting participants

the goal here is to find people that represent the audiences you are trying to reach. You will need to decide how many users you want to interview, what target audiences will be represented, and how you will recruit these participants!

The goal here is to find people that represent the audiences you are trying to reach. You will need to decide how many users you want to interview, what target audiences will be represented, and how you will recruit these participants!

### Prepare a discussion guide

A discussion guide is a document that outlines the questions and topics you want to cover during the interview, as well as a general timeline for the interview. It should also include a script to direct you on how to instruct the user. Depending on the type of interview you have chosen, the discussion guide may be extremely detailed and strict - or open-ended and flexible.

### Writing interview questions

To do this, it’s important to ask **open** and **non-leading** questions. An **open** question is a question that cannot be answered with a “yes” or “no” - requiring a user to go into more detail. A **leading question**  is a question that hints at a specific answer - *leading* the user to respond in a different way.

### **Setting Up the Environment & Making the User Feel Comfortable**

People are influenced by their physical environment. Ensuring a calm and positive environment will help your participants feel relaxed and focused on the task. Think about the convenience of your location for the user and how the location might lead to biased answers.

## ****User Interview Example****

Using [the mock user interview applet](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/understanding-the-user/how-to-conduct-user-interviews/user-interview-app/index.html)
below, you will go through the process of developing a research goal, preparing for the interview, and conducting an interview with one of these users.

## How to analyze qualitative data

Learn how to apply a variety of analysis methods on the qualitative data collected in user research studies.

### **What is qualitative data?**

- Qualitative user data is any non-numerical data collected in a user research study. These data are the thoughts, behaviors, opinions, perceptions, or feelings of the user that are recorded through the research method. For example, qualitative user data can be obtained through user interview transcripts, observations the researcher makes of how the participant interacts with an interface, or user survey responses.

Qualitative data is important in user research because it is a direct insight into users’ thoughts, feelings, and perceptions - information that is difficult to gather using numerical values.

Through qualitative analysis, we might learn that the reason that users spend the most time on this page is actually because the navigation menu is difficult to find and they are initially unsure how to navigate to the other pages.

To learn more about why qualitative data is important in UX research, read [Data Is More than Numbers: Why Qualitative Data Isn’t Just Opinions](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/qualitative-rigor/)
by the Nielsen Norman group.

****Organizing User Data from User Research****

1. **Gather:** all your data and convert them all into a common digital format.
2. **Categorize:** your data based on participants.Additionally, it would be helpful to include a document describing participant details, such as name, age, relevant characteristics, or anything else that might be helpful in understanding the user.
3. **Label**: your data accordingly to make it easy to find, access, and keep track of these data points. Refer back to the research objectives and add any additional notes that might make it easier throughout the analysis process.

### **Methods to analysis**

These methods are designed to help you uncover relevant themes, patterns, and stories represented in the the data.

**Thematic analysis** is a system of analysis with the purpose of identifying patterns to uncover relevant themes. A theme is an idea, need, or pattern of meaning that presents itself repeatedly in a data set.

1. **Coding data** is a thematic analysis tool in which segments of text are labeled using codes - easily identify, compare, and sort these points of data. A code is a word or phrase that represents a segment of text, acting as a shorthand for the description of the information. 

![Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 12.31.47 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-07_at_12.31.47_PM.png)

When building up coded data, it is helpful to have a reference to the description of each code and examples of what type of data is related.

Once the data is coded, you can use these codes to group, compare or contrast the data segments. Codes make it easy to parse through a large amount of qualitative data and quickly sort through them, discover relationships, and develop themes.

**Journalling** is a method where a researcher will record their thought process about a set of qualitative data. To do so, a researcher will annotate research materials, transcripts, or collected data as well as write down memos. Memos are notes the researcher makes on their ideas, thought processess, or reflections. 

Journalling can be effective way to develop themes, as well as a way to record the process of arriving at those themes.

**Affinity mapping** is an analysis method in which a researcher pulls important points from a data and categorizes them visually, creating a map of the data. Affinity mapping is useful to better sort and understand your data, as well as discover common themes that groups of data points might fall into.

The first step of creating an affinity map is to parse through all the data and pull out the important points. This process is very similar to the process of coding data. Each point should be written on an individual sticky note - either physically or digitally.

![Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 12.39.57 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-07_at_12.39.57_PM.png)

The benefits of the method are that it is highly collaborative, quick, cheap, and easy to conduct. It supports an iterative dynamic, which is crucial when using a design-thinking process. Finally, the visual nature makes it easy for a team to gain a shared understanding, summarize the data, develop themes, and have a good reference for the rest of the process.

### Afinity map example

In the [How to Conduct User Interviews](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-user-research-generative/articles/ui-and-ux-how-to-conduct-user-interviews) article, we covered how to conduct an effective user interview to gather relevant qualitative data. In that article, we followed the process of a research team developing a product to improve the process of building and sharing travel itineraries and plans. After doing some initial market research, the team identified the generation of millennials as a relevant target audience and recruited a participant named Amy to interview.

Take a look at [the Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPe5tgxM=/?utm_source=codecademy) to read over the user interview transcript and pick out key quotes, observations, notes, or ideas. Write any that come up on an individual sticky note.

## Developing findings & reporting insights

Once you have organized, analyzed, and found themes, it is time to synthesize the data to develop findings and insights.

A good framework for sharing a research finding is outlining an **insight** and **recommendation**. An **insight** is a pattern of observations made by the researcher based on the data. A **recommendation** describes how to sovle or improve upon the observation the insight desribes.

For example, let’s say a theme that was uncovered through an affinity map is **organizational lists**. The researchers observe that a number of the users they interviewed use lists or other category systems when planning for travel - and that they seem to be satisfied with these systems.

After developing a series of research findings, the next step is to create a research report that will outline the research goals, methodology, findings, and recommendations. A research report is a necessary and valuable tool to present the research to teams and stakeholders in a digestible way, ensuring that the findings are integrated effectively into the next stages of the design.

### Conclusion

Effectively analyzing the qualitative data gathered in your user research is a crucial component of the design process. By uncovering patterns, themes, and findings within qualitative data, you will have strong evidence and a clear direction to make successful user-centered decisions.

### Connect Best: User interview

The first step of any research study is to establish a problem statement. This problem statement will describe the specific and observable problem that you will be trying to learn more about through this study. You will use your problem statement as the basis for the remainder of this project.

Problem statement example: 

> *In the United States, adults report that it is difficult to meet people who share
similar hobbies and interests. They want to befriend like-minded people, but they don’t
know where to start. Additionally, it can be difficult to maintain friendships with people they don’t see on a regular basis. This problem is important because they want to enjoy good company in their free time.*
> 

In this project you will:

- Develop a Research Plan
- Prepare an Interview Discussion Guide
- Conduct User Interviews
- Analyze Data using an Affinity Map

Use the [Connect Best: User Interview Template](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPc3OPgQ=/?share_link_id=547975364020)
 to work through each task! If you get stuck or need some inspiration along the way, feel free to take a look at the [project walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UtyeRlFMkw)
.

## Settting up a research project

1. In this Codecademy project, you'll be working from a copy of this [Connect Best: User Interview](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPc3OPgQ=/) template. If you haven't already, follow the link and duplicate the board. Under the settings icon > go to "Board" > click "Make a copy"

1. 1. In the window that pops up, confirm you want to duplicate the board by clicking "Duplicate Board".
2. Once you have copied the template, close those tabs, click the "Open Boards" button below, and select "Copy of Connect Best: User Interview". You should be redirected to your copy of the board.

## Developping a Research plan

**First, we need to establish the background and research goals for this stufy.**

- Describe the observations you have made of the problem statement that will guide the study. Then, develop 1-2 clear research goals that describe what you hope to learn from the user interviews.
- Write in your background and research goals in the appropriate areas on the template.

**Choose to conduct an unstructured, semi-structured or structured interview study.**

- Check the correct interview method in the appropriate areas on the template. Then fill in the expected number of participants that you will interview. You should interview a minimum of 3 participants, but aim for an ideal number of 5.

Read the section Types of User Interviews in the article [How to Conduct User Interviews](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-user-research-generative/articles/ui-and-ux-how-to-conduct-user-interviews).

**Conduct some initial research to discover common characteristics of the target audience.**

Who are the users you will be interviewing? Under the participants section, describe the audience that you will be studying.

**In order to stay organized and keep the projet on track, you will want to established a timeline for these tracks.**

This project has a lot of steps - it can’t all be done in one sitting! You will need to finish up the research plan, recruit your participants, develop a discussion guide, schedule, prepare, and conduct the interviews, and analyze all the data.

Under the research timeline section, fill in the expected time and assigned tasks for the following tasks: Develop a Research Plan, Recruit Participants, Schedule Interviews, Develop a Discussion Guide, Conduct User Interviews, Conduct Data Analysis, and Create a Research Report.

**Now that you know who you want to recruit, you need to go find your participants.**

Decide how many participants you want to recruit, making sure to include a few extra just in case. Decide the method you want to use to recruit these participants, as well as how much your budget for recruitment is. Finally, build a recruitment screening form to qualify potential participants through the recruitment process. Your screening questions should elicit responses that give you enough information to qualify or disqualify a participant - but not enough to give the purpose of the study away! Use the article [How to use Screening Questions to Select the Right Participants for User Research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/screening-questions-select-research-participants/) for reference!

**Next, prepare the documents or materials you will need to conduct the study.**

It will be helpful to create a list of everything needed - as well as information such as deadlines, dependencies, and who is assigned to the task. These could be documents and materials such as recruitment posts, participant email communication, consent forms, discussion guides, etc.

**Using your research plan as a reference, recruit and finalize your participants.**

Once you have finalized your participants, find a time and location that works for each interview. In the template, note the scheduled date, time, and location for each interview. Now, it is time to move on to preparing for the interviews themselves!

for help!

## Develop a discussion guide

**First, you will want to decide what topics you want to cover in the interview to collect data to answer your research questions.**

Your interview questions may look different depending on the interview method you have chosen. For a structured interview, you will want to list out a number of specific questions and respective follow-up questions that you will ask every participant.

Look over your questions and make sure you can justify each question to a specific research goal. Once your questions have been finalized, you can move on to the next step and develop a script.

**First, you will want to decide what topics you want to cover in the interview to collect data to answer your research questions.**

Your interview questions may look different depending on the interview method you have chosen. For a structured interview, you will want to list out a number of specific questions and respective follow-up questions that you will ask every participant. For an unstructured interview, it may be sufficient to list out general talking points and goals to keep you on track when guiding the interview.

**Make sure to practice the script with someone else to get feedback and make any necessary tweaks!**

### Conduct User interviews

Arrive to the interview with ample time to set up and prepare before the participant arrives.

Once your participant arrives - don’t start the interview right away and take some time to get settled!

Conduct your interview using your discussion guide as a reference!

- Make sure to record the interview and take any needed additional notes

**Repeat tasks 11 - 13 with all of your participants.**

- The [User Interview Examples](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPe5thmw=/?moveToWidget=3458764531388924242&cot=14)

### Organize user data

Following the interview, gather and convert your data to a manageable and consistent format.

Transcribe your recordings. Organize your notes and participant information. Make sure you have everything you have collected all in one place.

Make sure your transcrits and notes are categorized based on participants

If you are using the user interview template, you can upload them directly into the Miro board. Label the data and add any final relevant notes or comments.

### Affinity Mapping

Read through each interview transcript and pull out any note, observation, or quote that is relevant to the research goals.

Read each sticky note one at a time and place on the map, looking for patterns and grouping similar sticky notes.

Take a look at each group of sticky notes and decide on a label for that category.

### How to conduct User surveys

Learn how to build a user survey, analyze the data, and avoid biases.

While [user interviews](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-user-research-generative/articles/ui-and-ux-how-to-conduct-user-interviews) are a great way to get insights into how individual users think about a design, process, or product, how do we find out what users think overall?

**User surveys** are a UX research method where designers and researchers create questions for a group of participants to answer about a design, process, or product. Along with user interviews, they serve as a platform for users to freely express how they feel about a topic or product.

Correctly written surveys provide meaningful quantitative data. Quantitative data is information that can be measured, counted, or viewed as a numerical value.

### What is a user survery?

**User surveys** are a UX research method where designers and researchers create questions for a group of participants to answer about a design, process, or product. Along with user interviews, they serve as a platform for users to freely express how they feel about a topic or product. A user survey can be used at many different points throughout the design process to check in with the users about how they feel when interacting with the design.

### Writing a research plan

You can download the [Research Plan Template](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPfqUgFo=/?share_link_id=791482474287)
 to follow along with the process of writing out a research plan for your first user survey!

### Research Goal

We can identify the research goal by asking, “What is the problem or problems we want to solve?” For this example scenario, our research goal is to understand the process people use to plan for a vacation and identify any pain points in this process.

### Research Questions

Research questions identify the specific points of interest you hope to learn more about by conducting a survey study. These questions help guide the development of a survey to ensure you answer the overall research goal.

For our example scenario, our research questions are:

- What is the ideal way for people to plan their travels?
- What are the tools people use to plan for a vacation?
- Are people likely to collaborate on the process of creating travel plans?

### Recruiting Participants

Depending on what our research goal is, we are not looking to survey anyone or everyone! More often than not, we are looking to learn about a specific group of users. By identifying the target audience, we can be sure to recruit survey participants that will provide relevant data.

For our example scenario, our target audience is people who enjoy traveling.

### ****Writing Survey Questions****

**Survey Structure**

A user survey should include an introduction, survey questions, and a wrap-up.

**Survey question types**

There are two types of survey questions: Closed-ended and open-ended questions.

### **Example User Survey**

****Now that you understand how to prepare a user survey, let’s go back to our scenario and build a sample example survey. 

Remember, our overarching research goal is to identify the process young adults use to plan for a vacation, where recommendations are found and evaluated, and how they feel about this process as a whole.

Keeping that in mind and referring back to our research plan, let’s build a survey.  

1. How frequently do users travel?  
2. How do users plan for vacations? 
3.  How do users collaborate in the planning process when traveling with others? 
4.  Demographics and Conclusion.

### Data analysis

Once you have stopped accepting responses to your survey, the next step is to organize and analyze your data in order to identify patterns, themes, and insights.

- Charts
- Bar charts
- Pie charts

### Biases

**Confirmation bias**: Confirmation bias is the tendency to look at data and interpret it in a way that supports our opinions and beliefs. Since, as the researcher, you know exactly what the goal of the study is, you might make connections that aren’t explicit in the data set, based on your own opinions, beliefs, or expectations on how the goal should be met.

**Framing effect:** The framing effect occurs when insights or findings are presented in a way that is disingenuous. This might be by failing to report other aspects of the data, using statistical measures that are skewed, or wording the finding to imply a certain idea or opinion. You want to present the data in a way that accurately represents respondents’ opinions.

### How to conduct card sorting

Learn what card sorting is and how to conduct your own in this step-by-step tutorial.

![Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 1.55.07 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-07_at_1.55.07_PM.png)

**Card sorting** allows designers to organize information in a way that makes sense to users, with the help of users! In a card sorting activity, participants are asked to organize cards into groups that make the most sense to them. Card sorting is often used to improve the information architecture of a website or any platform.

**Card sorting** is a user research technique that requires participants to organize cards into groups. For this to happen, researchers are required to write down keywords on either paper or digital notecards. This method is often used during the early stages of the research phase and is frequently used for designing information architecture.

![Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 1.59.07 PM.png](Day%2019%2080ba31e7f643451e80b3b60d27594ecf/Screen_Shot_2022-12-07_at_1.59.07_PM.png)

### Moderated card sorting

Moderated card sorting is when the researcher conducts a one-on-one interview with a participant to probe why the participant categorized the cards in one way or another.

This type of session provides *qualitative* data because researchers can ask follow-up questions and receive insights from participants as to why they placed a specific card in a certain group.

## **How to Conduct a Card Sorting Session**

There are many tools you can use to conduct a card sorting session. In-person sessions can be done using pen and paper, index cards, or sticky notes.

Card sorting can also be conducted virtually using online tools. We suggest [Miro](https://miro.com/?utm_source=codecademy)for this, given it’s wide array of features and ease-of-use, but some other tools include [Optimal Sort](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/) and [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/).

### Writing a Research Report

Learn how to gather user research and combine it into the form of a research report

What you need is a research report! Creating a research report can be done in many ways to properly communicate your findings to your audience.

What should the research report contain? Do you want it to be a written document or a presentation with visuals?

**What is a research report?**

A research report is a UX research deliverable that summarizes insights from a single user research study. It can be in various forms, such as a written report or a slide deck.

Before creating a research report, you should ask yourself a few questions. Who is the audience of the report? What are the key takeaways you want the audience to remember? To decide what to include, we first need to thoroughly understand what components go inside a research report.

### Research report formats

**Presentation report:** A slide presentation is one of the more popular ways to create a research report. The information about the research and findings are divided into slides. For example, one slide would discuss the executive summary, the next would discuss the background, and so on. We will go into the essential components of a research report in the next section.

**Written report:** A written research report is a written document that includes all user research and findings. It includes the same essential components as a presentation report, but instead of including main findings and summarized insights on a slide, a written report would aim to go into further depth. With that said, it can be lengthier than a presentation report.

### The essential components

A research report typically contains the following sections:

- **Executive Summary:** An executive summary is an overview included at the beginning of the research report that summarizes the key insights and the purpose of the study.
- **Background:** The background should include the *what* and the *why* of the project. This section of the report should include the context, discuss why you began research in the first place, and the problem you are trying to solve. This could be a one-sentence statement from a *previous* study, stating the problem that prompted you to conduct the *current*
 study you will be discussing.
- **Research Method:** In this section, you should discuss what user research methods you have used and why. This section should also include the number of participants in the study and the demographic / target audience. Explain how you recruited your participants, held interviews or usability testing sessions, and analyzed results.
- **Research Questions:** The research questions should come directly from your research plan. For example, the research questions from the example scenario in the [How to Conduct User Interviews](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-user-research-generative/articles/ui-and-ux-how-to-conduct-user-interviews) article were:
- **Findings:** Findings are a big part of the research report as they summarize what you’ve learned from conducting this study. This could be accompanied by a quote from a user interview or a graph from a user survey. What are the essential insights that you want the audience to take away? Findings can be referenced in a research report more than once.
- **Recommendations:** Consider this part your call to action. What do you want to do to solve this problem for users? What ideas do you and your teammates have to make a service, product, or process better for users?
- **What’s Next:** The name nearly speaks for itself! The “What’s Next?” slide should include the next steps for your research study. In this slide, briefly explain what you would like to do after the research is done, and why.

### Research Report best practices

- Make information digestible
- Consider the audience
- Think about visual design

### Creating personas

An overview of what personas are, how they support the design process, and how to create them.

A **[persona](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/persona)** is a fictional archetype of the target users of a product or design, created as a composite of user research or market research.

Broadly speaking, personas define the following about our users:

- Who are they? (behaviors, mindsets, demographics)
- What is their end goal?
- Why might they use the product?

Persona vs User Role

User roles define different types of users who will interact with the product. In comparison, personas provide more in-depth information about who users are and what they need from the product.

### Why use personas?

- **Make research personal**: This “profile format” helps us envision a human being rather than a collection of data points. When we can visualize a person, it becomes easier to empathize with the end users. Additionally, when we can make a personal connection to the data, it’s often easier to remember.
- **Establish a shared understanding**: As we work together, we must align on core aspects of the design, such as:
1. What problem will this design attempt to solve?
2. Who are we designing for?

### What’s included in a persona?

Common Elements

- **Name & Title**
- **Photograph or Illustration**
- **Demographic information:** This refers to biographical details such as age, gender, location, occupation, education, or experience with the product.
- **Goals**: The goals describe what the persona needs or wants to get done when they interact with the product. In general, users’ end goal is not to use a product! Instead, they’re using the product to accomplish a task or solve a problem.
- **Mindsets & Behaviors**
- **Scenario**

### A note on avoiding bias

One approach to mitigating bias in personas is to limit the demographic information. In addition to possibly creating bias, demographic information is not usually the most impactful part of the persona. More often than not, the persona’s goals, behaviors, and mindset will have more influence over our design. To learn more about de-emphasizing the role of demographic details in personas, check out [Maze’s resource on personas](https://maze.co/guides/user-personas).

### How can we create personas?

Personas are typically created during the “define” stage of the design thinking process. After conducting research in the “empathize” stage, we have the information needed to identify key characteristics of our users.

**Look for patterns in the data**

We can start by identifying patterns in users’ goals and behaviors:

- What are users trying to accomplish?
- What are their actions, habits, and routines?

While we’ll eventually dig into other elements, goals and behaviors are often a good starting point for defining our personas. For the travel app example, we could look for patterns in what users want to accomplish when they plan their trips (goals). Then, we might examine the actions that they take while planning (behaviors).

**Determine how many personas to create**

A product may have one or more personas. As a general rule, we don’t want too many personas because they can blur together. We can start by looking for major differences between users’ goals or behaviors. If there are significant differences, we can create one persona for each point of view (about 2-4 personas total).

**Include defining characteristics**

Once we have a general overview of each persona, we can elaborate on their key characteristics. If we use goals and behaviors as the foundation, then we can add details about mindset, such as frustrations, attitudes, and motivations. We might find a quote or two from the interview that conveys the persona’s core essence.

**Create a scenario** 

The scenarios clarify the context in which the persona will use our product.The scenario should be based on data and written from the persona’s point of view.

**Add personal touches**

By waiting to add personal details, we can mitigate implicit bias. This way, we avoid building a persona based on our perception of demographic information or a photograph.

**Choose a format**

You can also create persona templates from scratch with your design tool of choice. Overall, the goal is to display the information clearly, so that it’s easy for people to review the document and scan for specific details. It doesn’t need to look fancy in order to be useful! In fact, you may even try a [list-style persona](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/persona-examples/) if you want to keep it simple.

**Additional considerations**

1. Portray the person respectfully
2. iterate as needed
3. Put them to use

**Conclusion**

By creating personas, we create an artifact that equips us to follow a user-centered design process. To get the most value out of personas:

- Base the details on user research
- Focus on information that is relevant to the problem space
- Reference personas consistently during the design process
- Update the personas as new information is revealed
