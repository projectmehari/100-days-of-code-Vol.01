## Welcome to introduction to blockchain and crypto

## **What will you learn?**

After this conceptual course, you will be able to:

- Define key Blockchain and Crypto concepts like Dapps, Smart Contracts, NFTs, and DAOs.
- Understand the use cases and the pros and cons of web3 technology.
- Effectively choose whether or not web3 technology is something valuable for your career.
- Choose which web3 tech stack is most appropriate for your project/career.

Web3 can be loosely defined as a set of decentralized tools and protocols whose purpose is to build a more open internet. By effectively harnessing blockchain technology when appropriate, we can create applications that are both open to underprivileged users who may not have access to some financial systems and tools, as well as creating tools and products that can help users take ownership of their data, while helping creators to be fairly compensated for their work, without centralized control over this process.

- **Blockchain**: A network of computers all hosting, maintaining, and creating new “blocks” of data that are all chained together using cryptography, allowing us to keep an immutable ledger of the entire history of events that have happened on the network.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: The mechanism by which all the different computers in the blockchain network, nodes, come to agree on what data the ledger contains.
- **Proof of Work (PoW)** Consensus Mechanism: Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism. Involves computers doing a massive amount of cryptographic work in order to potentially win a chance at mining the next block, earning a block reward.
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)** Consensus Mechanism: Ethereum’s consensus mechanism. Involves participants staking their tokens, native currency of the network, in exchange for a chance to mine the next block, earning a reward.
- **Decentralized Application (Dapp)**: Shorthand for a piece of software that has at least some decentralized component.
- **Layers**: Different blockchains and systems that run on top of a base blockchain in order to unlock or improve existing functionality that may not be possible on the base layer.

### **Smart contracts**

One of the other use cases for blockchain technology is the use of smart contracts. **Smart contracts** are pieces of code that are deployed to the blockchain via a ledger system. Like a Bitcoin transaction, smart contract code gets deployed and recorded to the blockchain for all to see forever. Then anybody can call or view this smart contract code to enable transparent, censorship-resistant software that is not owned and cannot be controlled by any single entity.

### **DeFi**

Combining the money and the smart contract aspects of blockchain gets us one of the most prominent use cases for blockchain: **DeFi**, or decentralized finance. DeFi allows us to take the underlying money aspect of a blockchain and combine it with decentralized code via smart contracts to create a completely decentralized economy and financial system. This is one of the most, if not the single most, compelling use cases for blockchain technology.

### **NFTs**

**NFTs**, or non-fungible tokens, can be thought of as records of ownership represented on the blockchain. While these are primarily known because of JPEG profile pictures right now, their potential is massive.

### **DAOs**

**DAO** stands for decentralized autonomous organization, which is a fancy way of saying an organization that runs on the blockchain. The name is a bit of a misnomer because it still requires management and leadership. But the key difference, again, is that everything is transparent, verifiable, and decentralized. DAOs allow for functions like voting and membership that are all cryptographically verified and transparent.

### **Metaverse**

The “**metaverse**” is one of those nebulous terms that means something a bit different to everyone. Many people have a connotation of a sort of virtual reality where we give up our in-person lives for our blockchain-based digital second lives. It’s essentially just a collection of the various protocols and technologies we’ve outlined here to create some sort of decentralized system that we can take part in.

## Blockchain and decentralization

**What does decentralization mean?**

The simplest way to think about decentralized versus traditional centralized software is that **centralized** software is hosted and runs on a single computer or multiple computers run by a single entity. In a **decentralized** (or distributed) system, the code is running across a collection of computers all owned by individual entities. This network is usually open for anyone to join and participate in running a node.

It’s important to note that *decentralized systems are not unique to blockchains*. **Peer-to-peer (P2P)** networks like BitTorrent have existed for years. So what’s the difference?

- A P2P network like [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/) is a collection of different people running file hosting servers. With this model, if we want to download a file, we can download it from *any* of the servers in the network that host it, rather than needing to rely on a *single* source to download it.
- **[Gun** (a P2P database)](http://gun.eco/): Gun works similarly to BitTorrent, except it is used as traditional CRUD data storage that is hosted collectively across the network.
- **[Lightning** (a P2P payment network for Bitcoin)](https://lightning.network/): Lightning is a P2P layer 2 for Bitcoin. Lightning allows users to scale Bitcoin transactions by keeping a channel open, recording all the different transactions until the channel is closed, and sending the entire record of transactions to the Bitcoin chain at once.

**Why is decentralization useful?**

- **Security:** The “crypto” in cryptocurrency comes from **crypto**graphy. This is the mechanism that secures individual transactions on the blockchain as well as provides the backbone of the consensus mechanism known as Proof of Work. By leveraging public key cryptography, we can create highly secure identity and user management, despite the information and transactions being public.
- **Transparency**: Because blockchain networks are (or should be) open and viewable to all, they are highly transparent. If the network is not open and nodes are not able to be downloaded and verified by anybody, we cannot call the network decentralized.
- **Permanence:** Because of the ledger-like nature of blockchain networks, information written to blockchains is permanent. A blockchain is literally a chain of data blocks that are all connected together, so every transaction is recorded to that ledger permanently.

This trifecta of security, transparency, and permanence is what makes blockchain technology the ideal solution to create important infrastructure like money!

**How do blockchain accomplish decentralization?**

The best way to think about a **blockchain** is to imagine it like a ledger. At its core, that’s what a **blockchain** is: a globally verifiable ledger of transactions that is collectively run and verified by each member of the network. It is a ledger of transactions that every user has access to.

The key innovation of blockchains is solving the **[Byzantine Generals problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault).** Digital currencies had been in the works for years, but the core problem that nobody had cracked yet was the Byzantine Generals problem, also known as the double spending problem. The groundbreaking work of solving this problem was done by Satoshi Nakamoto when they created Bitcoin.

In the case of Bitcoin, a user’s currency is moved from their wallet (the record of how much of a token they currently own) to someone else’s wallet. This process is recorded to and verified by the entire network simultaneously, so it can’t happen twice.

### **Anatomy of a blockchain**

The mechanism we’ll be looking at is a simplified view of how Proof of Work blockchains function. There are three main components of a blockchain design that underpin its functionality:

- Blocks
- Nodes
- Miners

The blocks are the chunks of data that make up the blockchain. you can think of a blockchain as a chain of blocks of data connected to each other via their timestamps and hashes of their data.

Every block has three basic elements:

1. **Data**: the data contained in and written to the block
2. **Nonce**: The nonce is a randomly generated 32-bit whole number that generates a block header hash.
3. **Hash**: the hash is a 256-bit number that is connected to the nonce.

This chain of blocks is useless unless this ledger and process of writing new blocks can be watched and verified by a large number of distributed computers. These computers are called nodes.

This decentralization of nodes is what makes a blockchain decentralized. Unfortunately, decentralization and scaling a blockchain always comes with trade-offs: *The greater the computing requirements of a blockchain node, the less decentralized it can be*. To scale a blockchain and increase transaction throughput, we will usually need to discuss decreasing the number of nodes on the network required to approve the transaction.

Miners are in charge of creating new blocks on the blockchain. Every block has its own nonce and hash, but every block also references the previous block’s hash. In a proof of work system, mining is the process of utilizing software to brute force guess the correct nonce that will generate the correct hash.

### Consensus Mechanisms

The mining process requires miners to perform work using an external resource (energy) to actually “mine” and create new units of cryptocurrency. This method is specific to a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain like Bitcoin, but there are other consensus mechanisms.

Other consensus mechanisms, like proof of stake, aim to provide the data verification of PoW chain without the same energy needed, This has certain use cases, but it has important tradeoffs developers need to be aware of. 

We’ll go over those so we can make an informed decision about what kind of blockchain we want to build on.

### **Proof of work**

**Proof of Work (PoW)** is the consensus mechanism used by Bitcoin. It involves utilizing a *large* amount of computing energy to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle to win the privilege of mining a new block. We must “prove” we’ve done the “work” to earn the reward of a new block.

There are two critical things to keep in mind with PoW:

1. This consensus mechanism relies on external input. It requires using one valuable resource (energy) in order to produce another (Bitcoin).
2. A common criticism of PoW is this large energy usage. This is often described as a weak point and a disadvantage, but it’s important to understand why it is a feature, and not a bug, of PoW that it uses so much energy.

### Proof of stake

As an answer to PoW’s large energy usage, some blockchains have adopted a different form of consensus, **Proof of Stake (PoS)**. In the PoS model, rather than spending energy to solve a cryptographic puzzle, nodes called “validators” will lock up a certain amount of tokens to win a chance at proposing and validating new blocks.

So in PoW, the higher your hashrate (a measure of computing power), the higher your likelihood of being able to mine a new block. In PoS, the more of the native token you have staked, the higher your likelihood of being able to mine a new block. Validators are rewarded for honest behavior (proposing and validating legitimate transactions) and punished for dishonest behavior (attempting to write fraudulent blocks to the chain) by having their staked tokens slashed or burned

### Emerging consensus mechanisms

Proof of transfer (PoX) is a consensus mechanism unique to the [Stacks blockchain](https://stacks.org/).

- Stacks is a Layer 1 blockchain that allows for smart contracts and dapps to be built, and ultimately settle, on Bitcoin. Bitcoin itself cannot run smart contracts.

**Proof of Burn** is similar to Proof of Transfer, except the asset being transferred is *destroyed*. The economic model here is similar in that miners are spending one external resource to gain another.

### Proof of history

**Proof of History** is a unique consensus mechanism utilized by [Solana](https://solana.com/), along with Proof of Stake. Proof of History is a mechanism that allows validator nodes to quickly verify that a certain transaction happened between two specific points in time in the blockchain.

**Proof of Space** is another consensus mechanism used by the [Chia decentralized storage network](https://www.chia.net/). Proof of Space is a method for users to prove they are keeping unused space on a hard drive in reserve for network storage.

### Proof of access

The [Arweave protocol](https://www.arweave.org/) utilizes an interesting consensus mechanism called **Proof of Access**. To understand Proof of Access, it’s helpful to understand that Arweave is a *blockweave*, rather than a *blockchain*. While a blockchain is a collection of blocks where each block is linked to the *previous* block, a blockweave is a collection of blocks where each block is linked to *multiple* previous blocks.

### **Ethereum**

**[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/)** has moved from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake for the sake of *efficiency* and *energy usage*. While it will certainly gain these two things by leaving behind Proof of Work, it will come at a cost: an increased tendency toward centralization.

**Smart contracts**

At their core, **smart contracts** are chunks of code that live on the blockchain. If we think of a backend server with code running on it, smart contracts are very similar. The main difference is that smart contracts are *publicly accessible* and *immutable*
.

****Publicly accessible and transparent****

Since the blockchain is a shared historical ledger, all nodes have access to it, which means it is open and accessible to anybody. When we write a smart contract and deploy it to a blockchain, we are initiating a transaction to write that data to the blockchain. Then anybody can call that smart contract and interact with it.

### **Immutable**

Smart contracts are also (partially) immutable. Once a smart contract is deployed, the foundational code can’t be changed. We can modify the data only by calling functions defined in the smart contract.

In something like a JavaScript program, if we modify data, we need to save it to a database for it to persist. In a smart contract, if data is modified, it gets modified by the user sending a transaction and that change is permanently written to the blockchain. Rather than storing the data in a database, the change happens directly in the code itself on-chain. *This process is inefficient and should only be used for the critical data that needs to be stored on-chain*.

Transparency and immutability are what give smart contracts their superpowers. These traits allow us to use smart contracts to build decentralized financial systems that are:

- Accessible to everyone
- Censorship-resistant web applications
- Permanent verifiable records of ownership (via NFTs)
- Transparent organizations via (DAOs)

### **Finance and DeFi**

One of the most common use cases for smart contracts is in the world of finance. This makes sense, as the original use for blockchain technology itself was Bitcoin, designed to be a superior form of money. You can think of financial smart contracts, also known as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), as replacing any functionality of a bank. This has profound implications for the world and the economy. What Bitcoin did for money, DeFi has the potential to do for the economy.

Ethereum was created in order to create a network that is able to be *programmable*
money. This made it possible to not only create a form of money based on immutable code, but to recreate financial services using immutable, transparent code.

While Ethereum takes the approach of having the money and robust programmability on the same layer, other chains like Stacks separate these two layers.

## **Common Smart Contract Exploits and Pitfalls**

It’s no secret that writing smart contracts can be dangerous business if done incorrectly. Poorly written smart contracts have been the source of millions of dollars lost or stolen assets. It’s important to be aware of security best practices when writing smart contracts. Some of these will be dependent on the language you are using, but we’ll two common issues here.

For more on this, check out the [Decentralized Application Security Project](http://dasp.co/).

### Smart contract languages: Solidity, Clarity, and Rust

Now that we’ve looked at the conceptual ideas and applications behind smart contracts, let’s get a bit more technical and look at how we can actually build them. There are many different smart contract languages, just as there are many different chains. We’ll be looking at three of them:

- **Solidity:** Solidity is the smart contract language used on the Ethereum chain, as well as most other EVM chains like Polygon and Avalanche. Solidity is the first and most commonly used smart contracting language, and currently dominates the market of developers.
- **Clarity:** Clarity is a relatively new smart contract programming language that was built for [the Stacks blockchain](https://www.stacks.co/).
- **Rust:** Chains like Solana and NEAR utilize Rust to build their smart contracts. Rust is a very popular language that actually has the highest developer satisfaction of any language.

## **Building NFTs**

Building smart contracts to handle NFTs comes down to a few key components. Each of these will be implemented slightly differently depending on the specific NFT and the chain it is built on, but this is a good generalization of the structure we’re likely to see.

- **Token Name**: This is the text representation of what the NFT collection is called.
- **Token ID**: An identifier that is unique to identify each individual NFT, usually an integer.
- **Token URI/Metadata**: This is a set of data that defines the token’s traits. For example, in a PFP project, this would be the different traits we see listed in an NFT marketplace. This metadata is stored at the token URI and a best practice is to store this data on a decentralized network like IPFS.
- **Owner**: The address of the NFT owner.
- **Mint**: A function responsible for allowing a user to mint an NFT.
- **Transfer**: A function allowing a user to transfer an NFT to another user.
- **Burn**: A function allowing a user to permanently destroy an NFT.

[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) uses the [ERC-721 token standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) to define NFTs. A popular library to use for this is OpenZeppelin. So if we wanted to begin the process of [creating an NFT on Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-an-nft/#write-contract), we would create a new contract that inherited from OpenZeppelin’s ERC721 class.

## **NFTs on Bitcoin**

You can’t actually create NFTs directly on [the Bitcoin chain](https://bitcoin.org/en/). Due to Bitcoin’s limited scripting language, we can’t create the smart contracts we would need to create an NFT. We can utilize [the Stacks chain](https://www.stacks.co/) and Clarity to create NFTs that ultimately settle on Bitcoin, allowing us to leverage some of the security of Bitcoin to house our NFTs.

We can do this using Stacks’ version of NFT standard implementation, [the SIP-009 trait](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-009/sip-009-nft-standard.md). SIPs are Stacks Improvement Proposals, and they are changes to the network designed to improve functionality. SIP-009 is a standard for creating NFTs.

## **NFTs on Solana**

NFT projects are extremely popular on [Solana](https://solana.com/) due to its speed and Metaplex. [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/) is a robust suite of tools and smart contracts designed to make launching NFTs easier. The Metaplex Storefront is a protocol built on Solana that allows creating and minting of NFTs, starting auctions, and provides a standard of visualization across wallets. It’s a set of both smart contracts and a frontend that developers can take and build off of to easily spin up NFT projects built on a shared standard.

## **How DAOs are Structured**

DAOs are a series of intentionally designed smart contracts with a UI that allows people to interact with them. In a DAO, smart contracts are used for:

1. Enforcing voting processes
2. Treasury management

These are two of the primary use cases of a DAO, but a DAO could be organized around all sorts of things! In general, community members will create proposals for the project and then vote on them in order to drive the project forward.

Once a DAO is formed, and its code pushed to the blockchain, it usually requires a certain amount of votes in order to change anything. Often, DAOs utilize governance tokens issued to members in order to determine who has the right to vote and what they can vote on.

## ****Use Cases and Examples of DAOs****

### **Developer DAO**

This is a good example of a collective/community. [Developer DAO](https://www.developerdao.com/) is a group of developers all working in web3 and seeking to grow and collaborate together. It requires holding an NFT to be enter the Discord. One in, we work with the community to make decisions about:

- Projects to take on
- Content to create
- Community initiatives

### **MolochDAO**

[MolochDAO](https://molochdao.com/) is more of a protocol-level project. It seeks to provide a template for other projects to build on and be an industry standard for how to model a DAO. DAOHaus is a no-code tool that allows anyone to spin up their own DAO that follows the implementation standards of MolochDAO.

### **RaidGuild**

[RaidGuild](https://www.raidguild.org/) is a design and development agency operating as a DAO. It’s one of the larger DAOs in the ecosystem, and they have a high demand for their services. This is a good example of something that could have been a traditional company but is operating as a DAO in order to ensure transparency and decentralization in their operations.

Members must go through a series of tasks in order to join and then be nominated to become a member. From there, members are free to pick up work that interests them while contributing to the improvement of the community.

## **What is a dapp?**

A **Decentralized Application (Dapp)** is essentially an application that has at least *one component* hosted on a *decentralized* architecture. Dapps exist on a spectrum. We can have dapps where there is some core functionality that runs on a blockchain via a smart contract, but everything else runs on traditional centralized web2 architecture. Or we can have *every single piece* of the application running on some sort of decentralized system.

## **Web2 vs web3 stacks**

A typical, simplified web2 stack might include a:

- Client
- Server
- Database

Let’s look at what we might use for a tech stack to build this out. (Web 2)

- Front End: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- API/Authentication/Database/File Storage: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- Hosting: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Payments: [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

In web3, each of the web2 components has a corresponding component in web3, although they function and interact a bit differently. Here’s how the architecture components from above might translate into a decentralized version.

- Front End: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (stays the same)
- API: Data from smart contracts and the blockchain itself
- Authentication: Decentralized identity management via wallet software like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Hiro](https://www.hiro.so/), or [Phantom](https://phantom.app/)
- Database: Combination of storing data directly in smart contracts and using decentralized data storage
- File Storage: Decentralized data storage system like IPFS, [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/), or [Gun](https://gun.eco/)
- Hosting: Similar to file storage mechanisms like IPFS or [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/)
- Payments: Direct payments on-chain using the corresponding cryptocurrency

****Why Build on Decentralized Blockchain Architecture?****

- censorship resistance
- User ownership
- Trustless architecture
- Native digital payments

### Blockchain infrastructure: Web3 stack

**Indexing and querying**

** **Infura**: If we use a tool like [Infura](https://infura.io/), for example, we are provided with a REST endpoint that we can use to run data queries on the blockchain. If we want to monitor the chain for certain activities, like NFT purchases, we can do this by using another one of these tools. There are both centralized and decentralized methods of querying and posting blockchain data.

**Centralized data layer**

The following list of tools are similar, it’s just a matter of preference on which you want:

- [Stacks API](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/blockchain/stacks-blockchain-api)
- [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/)
- [Infura](https://infura.io/)
- [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/)

**Decentralized data layer**

These are some options for interacting with the blockchain from a decentralized service:

- [KYVE Network](https://www.kyve.network/)
- [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/)
- [Pocket Network (POKT)](https://www.pokt.network/)

**Oracles**

What if our dapp relies on some set of data that exists in the real world? How can we access data and ensure it is real and accurate? This is where oracles come in. **Oracles** are entities that provide external data that we can use in our smart contracts.

Two examples of popular oracle services you can use are:

- [RedStone](https://redstone.finance/)
- [Chainlink](https://chain.link/)

**Blockchain development environment**

Blockchains have **mainnets**, the live blockchain, and **testnets**, which are used for development purposes. Even though testnets are just for development, they are still public and distributed. This means developing locally and needing to deploy your contract any time you want to change anything or during the development process would make development slow and cumbersome.

Some options for development environments are:

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [Anchor Protocol](https://www.anchorprotocol.com/)

**Wallets and identity management**

In the web2 world, we authenticate with usernames and passwords. In the *decentralized*web3, world we authenticate using cryptography and public/private key pairs. The user-facing mechanism we use to do that is called a wallet. A **wallet** is a piece of software that allows us to create an address on a blockchain and then authenticate using our private key to access it.

Some options for this are:

- [Hiro Web Wallet](https://wallet.hiro.so/wallet/install-web)
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Phantom](https://phantom.app/)

### Off-chain data storage

What we really care about here is trustless data integrity. We want to ensure that our data can’t be tampered with and that it is transparently verifiable. What we could instead do is store the data off-chain in either a traditional database or in a decentralized solution. Then, we store a hash of that data on-chain in our smart contract. This way we are guaranteeing the validity of our data on-chain without having to store the data itself. Then, in our app, we compare the hash with the hash stored on-chain to verify any changes.

Some options for this are:

- [Gun](https://gun.eco/)
- [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/)
- IPFS
- [Gaia](https://gaiadao.money/)
- [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network/)

### **Overall web stack process**

1. First, we need to choose what chain we want to build on. Let’s say we choose to build on Stacks
2. The next thing we would need to do is how we want to access the data from the blockchain. In this case, we’ll utilize the stacks API provided by Hiro
3. Next we’ll get set up with our Clarinet development environment so we can spin up a local chain.
4. And we’ll need to integrate our app with the Hiro Web Wallet for authentification and identity management
5. We’ll also have some data that we don’t necessarily want on-chain, we’ll set ourselves up with [gun.eco](http://gun.eco) for our decentralized off-chain data storage.
6. Next we need to choose a client library, and in this case we’ll choose Micro-Stacks and build our actual front end using Remix
7. Finally, we need a way to host our dapp. We can go to traditional route of centralized hosting using something like Vercel or Netlify. Or, if we want our dapp, to be 100% decentralized we can deploy it to Arweave or IPFS.

## ****Creating a Metaverse and a Web3 Stack****

### ****What is the Metaverse?****

The **Metaverse** is one of those terms that is hard to define. For our purposes we can define it as a cohesive collection of web3 tech that allows people to work toward an overarching goal. It doesn’t necessarily have to imply any sort of gaming or virtual reality. All it really is is a set of connected web3 protocols all centered around a common goal.
