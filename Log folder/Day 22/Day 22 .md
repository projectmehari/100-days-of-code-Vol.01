### Introduction to A-Frame

**What is virtual reality?**

[Virtual reality (VR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality) is a technology that uses head-mounted headsets with displays to generate realistic images, sounds, and other sensations to put users into an immersive virtual environment. VR allows us to create unbounded worlds that people can walk around and interact with using their hands, to feel as if they were transported to another place.

**What is WebXR?**

[WebXR](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr)  is an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) that allows developers to create XR experiences; a catch-all term that spans virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and newly-developed immersive technologies.

[A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) is a popular open-source web framework for building virtual reality experiences in the browser.

The language’s core is a powerful entity-component framework that can be programmed extensively by [three.js](https://threejs.org/), a JavaScript library used to render 3D graphics.

A-Frame *primitives*, such as `<a-box>`, are a wrapper of larger pieces of code that we can easily reuse in our program.

They are great ways for beginners to create 3D objects, also known as *meshes*, right off the bat. They usually have a name that’s easy to remember and come with a bunch of components (i.e. `position`, `color`, `width`).

### Brainstorm about VR project

- Create a story guideline
- Film a scene using an insta 360 camera
- Use A-frame framework to insert it as code.
- Find a VR video template
- Explore minting it as a NFT
