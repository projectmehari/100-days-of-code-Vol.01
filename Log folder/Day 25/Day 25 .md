### Notes

**Fully on-chain generative art**

*with Harm van den Dorpel (artist)*

Smart contract programming 

Orb (lite) - 

Rotating nested squircles: a fully [on-chain](https://www.thisispaper.com/tag/on-chain) spin-off of "Markov's Dream: Orb" by Harm van den Dorpel, 2022.

Colours, amount of rings, rotation speed and curvature are determined on mint. The animated vector graphics that compose this artwork are entirely generated by the Solidity code that the smart contract was programmed in. It does not rely on any web server or off-chain storage solution like IPFS, which means that this artwork is indestructible and will live on as long as the [Ethereum](https://www.thisispaper.com/tag/ethereum) blockchain exists.

Read contract

- Token ID

To be able to discern if a project is “fully on-chain” vs if parts of it is stored on IFPS or arweave.

- Cost of storing onchain can be expensive.
- The is a fragility to art works not being stored completely onchain.

The seed hash determines the speed, colors, etc of the NFT minted.

Look into the tooling to make sure that NFT is seeded into a IPFS

### Intro to React.js - Chapter 1

**reactjs.org**

- from facebook/react
- [Awesome-react](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react)

How is react different from javascript?

- Components and props based
- State and lifecycle
- Virtual DOM and internals
    - The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciation
    - This approach enables the declarative API of React: You tell React what state you want the UI to be in, and it makes sure the DOM matches that state. This abstracts out the attribute manipulation, event handling, and manual DOM updating that you would otherwise have to use to build your app.
    - Since “virtual DOM” is more of a pattern than a specific technology, people sometimes say it to mean different things. In React world, the term “virtual DOM” is usually associated with React elements since they are the objects representing the user interface. React, however, also uses internal objects called “fibers” to hold additional information about the component tree. They may also be considered a part of “virtual DOM” implementation in React.

What are the limitations of React?

- it could be harder to be compatible with other frameworks

Introduction to hooks and event handlers

1. **State hook**
2. **Effect hook**

At the end, make sure to adjust the website for mobile by checking if they user experience is fluid for each view ( Iphone, android, etc)
