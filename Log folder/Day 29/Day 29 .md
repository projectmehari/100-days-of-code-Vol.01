**OVERVIEW OF THE INTERNET**

## **Review**

Congratulations! You should now have a general understanding of how the internet works, including:

- The growth of the internet as a network
- The difference between the internet and the world wide web
- The relationship between browsers and servers
- HTTP status codes, like 404 Not Found
- Big trends in web development, from static websites to Web 2.0 and the rise of mobile

If you work with engineers, this information will help you talk about websites and web applications at a more technical level. Or if you’re interested in becoming a web developer yourself, you now have the important context to start building your own website or web application!

## **What is HTML**

Alejandra knows that the first step to building a website is learning HTML. Why? *HTML* is the skeleton of all web pages. It provides structure to the content on a website, including text, images, buttons, videos, and more.

HTML is a practical place to start learning to code. You can build basic websites after learning just a little HTML, with text, images, and videos. You can always open up your work-in-progress website with your browser and see what you’re building.

## **What is CSS?**

Using just HTML, Alejandra was able to build a website that contains all of the content that she wants. But it doesn’t look very impressive—Alejandra knows that a basic black and white website won’t give her business the credibility she needs to find new customers.

That’s where CSS comes in! *CSS* is the language that provides *style* to the content of an HTML page. This includes colors, fonts, positioning, layout, and more!

Why do we need a separate language for content and presentation? This is an example of the computer science principle *separation of concerns*. Large codebases are kept maintainable when each section has clearly differentiated problems that it is trying to solve.

Since the styling rules are described separately from the content itself, if Alejandra adds more paragraphs, images, or other forms of content, she can expect them to be styled the same way as her existing content. This will save Alejandra time in the long run, especially as her website gets more and more complex.

## **What is JavaScript?**

Now that Alejandra has her website looking polished, she’s realized that she wants the site to be more interactive. She would like to build a shopping cart feature that allows her users to buy travel packages directly from her website.

To accomplish this, Alejandra is going to need to learn JavaScript. Any website that provides more than just static information probably utilizes JavaScript in some way.

## **What is SQL?**

Now that Alejandra has built out the user-facing checkout features of her website, she’s realized that she needs to store all of this information somewhere! She needs her application to be able to store, retrieve, and modify data like usernames, shipping addresses, payment information, and more.

In order to build out these features, Alejandra needs to learn some *SQL*, which stands for **s**tructured **q**uery **l**anguage. You might be familiar with SQL as a language that Data Analysts and Data Scientists use to query and analyze data.

SQL stores information in tables, which is simply a collection of information organized into rows and columns. If you’ve worked with a spreadsheet like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, you might be familiar with working with tables. To get the information, you would write a *query*, or a program that would retrieve data from the table.
