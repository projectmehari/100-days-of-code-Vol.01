After this unit, you will be able to:

- Apply more custom colors and fonts
- Style navigation elements like links and buttons
- Create secondary (breadcrumb) navigation

**COLOR**

## **Review**

We’ve completed our extensive tour of the colors in CSS! Let’s review the key information we’ve learned.

There are four ways to represent color in CSS:

- Named colors—there are more than 140 named colors, which you can review [here on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color).
- Hexadecimal or hex colors
    - Hexadecimal is a number system that has sixteen digits, 0 to 9 followed by “A” to “F”.
    - Hex values always begin with `#` and specify values of red, blue, and green using hexadecimal numbers such as `#23F41A`.
    - Six-digit hex values with duplicate values for each RGB value can be shorted to three digits.
- RGB
    - RGB colors use the `rgb()` syntax with one value for red, one value for blue and one value for green.
    - RGB values range from 0 to 255 and look like this: `rgb(7, 210, 50)`.
- HSL
    - HSL stands for hue (the color itself), saturation (the intensity of the color), and lightness (how light or dark a color is).
    - Hue ranges from 0 to 360 and saturation and lightness are both represented as percentages like this: `hsl(200, 20%, 50%)`.
- You can add opacity to color in RGB and HSL by adding a fourth value, `a`, which is represented as a percentage.

Great job! Feel empowered to add a bit of color to each of your projects!

## **Typography**

In this lesson, we’ll focus on *typography*, the art of arranging text on a page. We’ll look at:

- How to style and transform fonts.
- How to lay text out on a page.
- and how to add external fonts to your web pages.

---

## **Review**

Great job! You learned how to style an important aspect of the user experience—typography.

Let’s review what you’ve learned so far:

- *Typography* is the art of arranging text on a page.
- Text can appear bold or thin with the `font-weight` property.
- Text can appear in italics with the `font-style` property.
- The vertical spacing between lines of text can be modified with the `line-height` property.
- *Serif* fonts have extra details on the ends of each letter. *Sans-Serif* fonts do not.
- *Fallback fonts* are used when a certain font is not installed on a user’s computer.
- The `word-spacing` property changes how far apart individual words are.
- The `letter-spacing` property changes how far apart individual letters are.
- The `text-align` property changes the horizontal alignment of text.
- Google Fonts provides free fonts that can be used in an HTML file with the `<link>` tag or the `@font-face` property.
- Local fonts can be added to a document with the `@font-face` property and the path to the font’s source.

# **Introduction: Making a Website Responsive**

**In this unit, you will utilize responsive web design practices.**

The goal of this unit is to utilize responsive web design practices. You will learn how to create websites that can be viewed on a variety of devices and use different layouts and positioning.

After this unit, you will be able to:

- Understand responsive web design
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, positioning, and responsiveness
- Use media queries

You will put all of this knowledge into practice with an upcoming Challenge Project. You can complete the Challenge Project either in parallel with or after taking the prerequisite content—it’s up to you!

**GRID ESSENTIALS**

## **Introduction to Grids**

Using CSS, you can elegantly lay out elements on a web page. There is no simple answer for how best to do this — depending on what content you are trying to display, multiple different techniques can work well. The [Box Model](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/box-model-intro/exercises/box-model-intro) and [Display and Positioning](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-display-positioning/exercises/html-flow) explain some possible ways to style layout.

In this lesson, we introduce a powerful tool called *CSS Grid*. The *grid* can be used to layout entire web pages. Whereas [Flexbox](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/learn-flexbox-l/exercises/flexbox) is mostly useful for positioning items in a one-dimensional layout, CSS grid is most useful for two-dimensional layouts, providing many tools for aligning and moving elements across both rows and columns.

By the end of this lesson, you will understand how to use these properties to create grid layouts:

- `grid-template-columns`
- `grid-template-rows`
- `grid-template`
- `grid-template-area`
- `row-gap` / `column-gap` / `gap`
- `grid-row-start` / `grid-row-end`
- `grid-column-start` / `grid-column-end`
- `grid-area`

That’s a lot to learn. But by the end, you’ll be a master at grid positioning. Let’s start learning!

**GRID ESSENTIALS**

## **Review**

At this point, we’ve covered a great deal of different ways to manipulate the grid and the items inside it to create interesting layouts.

- `grid-template-columns` defines the number and sizes of the columns of the grid
- `grid-template-rows` defines the number and sizes of the rows of the grid
- `grid-template` is a shorthand for defining both `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` in one line
- `row-gap` puts blank space between the rows of the grid
- `column-gap` puts blank space between the columns of the grid
- `gap` is a shorthand for defining both `row-gap` and `column-gap` in one line
- `grid-row-start` and `grid-row-end` makes elements span certain rows of the grid
- `grid-column-start` and `grid-column-end` makes elements span certain columns of the grid
- `grid-area` is a shorthand for `grid-row-start`, `grid-column-start`, `grid-row-end`, and `grid-column-end`, all in one line

You have seen how to set up and fill in a grid and you now have one more CSS positioning technique to add to your toolkit! Let’s do some practice to solidify these skills.

**FLEXBOX**

## **Review: Flexbox**

You should be proud of yourself! You have learned the most important properties of flexbox. Flexbox is an art and a science; you can use it to make laying out multiple elements a piece of cake. You know everything necessary to begin using it in your own projects.

1. `display: flex` changes an element to a block-level container with flex items inside of it.
2. `display: inline-flex` allows multiple flex containers to appear inline with each other.
3. `justify-content` is used to space items along the main axis.
4. `align-items` is used to space items along the cross axis.
5. `flex-grow` is used to specify how much space (and in what proportions) flex items absorb along the main axis.
6. `flex-shrink` is used to specify how much flex items shrink and in what proportions along the main axis.
7. `flex-basis` is used to specify the initial size of an element styled with `flex-grow` and/or `flex-shrink`.
8. `flex` is used to specify `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` in one declaration.
9. `flex-wrap` specifies that elements should shift along the cross axis if the flex container is not large enough.
10. `align-content` is used to space rows along the cross axis.
11. `flex-direction` is used to specify the main and cross axes.
12. `flex-flow` is used to specify `flex-wrap` and `flex-direction` in one declaration.
13. Flex containers can be nested inside of each other by declaring `display: flex` or `display: inline-flex` for children of flex containers.

**ADVANCED CSS GRID**

## **Review**

Great work! You have learned many new properties to use when creating a layout using CSS Grid! Let’s review:

- `grid-template-areas` specifies grid named grid areas
- grid layouts are two-dimensional: they have a row, or inline, axis and a column, or block, axis.
- `justify-items` specifies how individual elements should spread across the row axis
- `justify-content` specifies how groups of elements should spread across the row axis
- `justify-self` specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the row axis
- `align-items` specifies how individual elements should spread across the column axis
- `align-content` specifies how groups of elements should spread across the column axis
- `align-self` specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the column axis
- `grid-auto-rows` specifies the height of rows added implicitly to the grid
- `grid-auto-columns` specifies the width of columns added implicitly to the grid
- `grid-auto-flow` specifies in which direction implicit elements should be created

This is a great time to experiment with the code in the code editor and try any of the properties you want to practice more! When you’re ready, move on!
