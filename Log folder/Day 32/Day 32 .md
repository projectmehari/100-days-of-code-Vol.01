****Guest Talk with Janine Leger | Zuzalu: a first of it's kind IRL pop-up Community****

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnLUqtceQzA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnLUqtceQzA)

Janine was one of the co-creators of Zuzalu, a 2 month long IRL pop-up community in Montenegro of 200 full-time residents and 700 visitors. The community was from a variety of interest areas including Ethereum Infrastructure, public goods, ZK tech, Longevity and Philosophy from across the world. Janine will share about Zuzalu and the value of building self-sustaining communities that have a positive impact on the world.

**What are protocols that we naturally opt-in in our lives? ( as a family member, as a resident of your city, etc)

### Cultural evolutions

We’ve moved further and further away from living in our natural state as tribes in community.

Tribes > Agriculture > Industrial revolution > Remote work & isolation

** The loneliness epidemic in a search term ( Interest in findings connection is at records times).

**A Missing piece: Coordinating Sustainable Communities**

*Testing out a different realm more similar to tribes*

**Zuzalu: Community Building Priorities**

- Proximity
    - Serendipitous interactions
    - Low lever of logistical overhead
    - Increased autonomy
- Core principles centered around kindness, curiosity & trust
    - A greater sense of trust improves:
        - Social cohesion / Collaboration
        - Innovation and progress
        - Resilience and adaptability
        - Well being
- Decentralized social tech
    - eg. Schoolscapes
- Rituals
    - Building good rituals can take off a lot of the logistics load.
- Zuzalu: Local  community integration
    - involving locals in the process. Eg. Montenegro citizens were participants in the experiments.
- Zuzalu’s Ripple effects

**Testing ground for decentralized coordination enabled by ZK Applications.**

> *“Zuzalu is a social experiment and prototype of an innovative community for human beings. From this, we can not only see what Ethereum will be like in the next ten years, but also what human technology and community will be like in the next ten years.”*
> 

In web2, there isn’t any spaces that create inherent socialization. In web3, there is this curiosity to share and experiment that propels a type of network effects.

*Social tech for self organized events: Zuzalu.city*

![Screen Shot 2023-08-03 at 4.49.29 PM.png](Day%2032%2043e63b38df0e413ba4d264766d092f45/Screen_Shot_2023-08-03_at_4.49.29_PM.png)

*Decentralized events*

Find people within your community that want to steward a theme and let them curate an event. (sub-event)

**Extra notes**

- Make sure there is a easy opt-out
- Keep the core group small
- Are you willing to ask your community for help?
- The event was funded by Vitalik who put up 1.8 million to create zuzalu. The participants paid around 2k/month for living costs.

## ****Getting Started with Visual Studio Code****

### **What are ‘text editors’?**

Text editors, also called code editors, are applications used by developers to write code. They can highlight and format your code so that it’s easier to read and understand. If you’ve used Codecademy, you’re already familiar with a text editor. It’s the area you write your code in.

Using a text editor is part of creating your “development environment,” the set of tools that you use for working on coding projects. It will allow you to take what you’ve learned on Codecademy and put it into practice as you work on projects on your computer. Not only will this introduce you to tools that are commonly used by professional developers but it also means that you’ve grown as a developer and are ready to start working on your own—great work!

### **What are development folders?**

Before using your text editor, it’s important to establish an organized [file system](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/file-paths). As the number and size of your projects grow, it becomes increasingly important to know where to save new projects and find old projects.

Most developers store their projects in an easy-to-find directory, (what you might be used to calling a “folder”). Here at Codecademy, we recommend naming this folder as **`projects`**. It will store all of your coding projects. Whenever you create a new project, no matter how small, you should always make a new folder inside your **`projects`** directory. You will find that single-file projects can quickly turn into larger, multi-folder projects.

## **Introduction: Deploying Websites**

**In this unit, you will be introduced to web hosting and the command line.**

The goal of this unit is to introduce you to web hosting and deploying websites with GitHub Pages. You will also learn how to use the command line to navigate file structures.

After this unit, you will be able to:

- Understand web hosting
- Deploy a simple website using GitHub pages
- Navigate file structures

**NAVIGATION**

## **Introduction**

The **command line** is a text interface for your computer. It’s a program that takes in commands and passes them on to the computer’s operating system to run.

From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Finder on Mac OS or Windows Explorer on Windows. The difference is that the command line is fully text-based.

The advantage of using the command line is its power. You can run programs, write scripts to automate common tasks, and combine simple commands to handle difficult tasks. All of these traits come together to make it an important programming tool.

This course is for unix-based systems such as Linux and Mac OS X. You can also download programs on Windows that will allow you to use the same commands. An appendix of all commands taught in this course is available [here](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands).

## **Review**

Congratulations! You’ve learned five commands commonly used to navigate the filesystem from the command line. What can we generalize so far?

- The *command line* is a text interface for the computer’s operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.
- A *filesystem* organizes a computer’s files and directories into a tree structure. It starts with the *root directory*. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.
- From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:
    - `pwd` outputs the name of the current working directory.
    - `ls` lists all files and directories in the working directory.
    - `cd` switches you into the directory you specify.
    - `mkdir` creates a new directory in the working directory.
    - `touch` creates a new file inside the working directory.
- You can use helper commands to make navigation easier:
    - `clear` clears the terminal
    - tab autocompletes the name of a file or directory
    - ↑ and  allow you to cycle through previous commands
