- **Unstoppable**: It doesn’t require maintenance, by nature of running on a blockchain. Protocol can run forever with no ability to stop them. Example: Uniswap (onchain) vs coinbase (offchain) // Opensea (offchain) vs Zora (onchain)
- This is a net capability unlocked by blockchains.
- **Free**: There is no cost to maintain or operate the protocol. If there is a protocol-wide fee on the protocol, the cost to fork is negligible. ** at gas cost
- **Expansive**: Built-in incentives that be utilized by anyone adding value in a codified manner on top of the protocol. These fees are transparent and available to the entire ecosystem. Example: Uniswap LP fee // Zora finders fee
- **Permissionless**: The protocol is universally acessible, everyone is able to utilize it completely without prejudice. It is unable to change its core operating functionality.
- **Credibly neutral**: It does not discriminate for or against any specific people
- Positive sum environment: you can see competitive actors utilize a shared system instead of trying to do it themselves.
- **Valuable**: Example: What is the value creation in the nouns model?

Built to be built on.

Why does this matter?

If web3 is a new internet, then the protocols of web3 will be powering most of society’s value exchange.

Crypto gives us the opportunity to create public infrastructure free of monopolistic control, we should take that opportunity.

Hyperstructures” is a checklist as much as it is a definition.

Given their immutable and permanent nature, we have the opportunity to create civilizational infrastructure that can outlast our own lifetimes — all of which is native to the internet.
