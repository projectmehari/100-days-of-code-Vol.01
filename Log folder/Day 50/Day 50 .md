### TypeScript introduction

[Learn TypeScript: Fundamentals | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-typescript-fundamentals)

### **What is TypeScript?**

So now that we knowÂ *why* TypeScript exists, letâ€™s talk about how we use it:

- First, we write TypeScript code in files with the extensionÂ **.ts**.
- Next, we run our code through the TypeScriptÂ [transpiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler). The transpiler will check that the code adheres to TypeScriptâ€™s standards, and it will display errors when it does not.
- If the TypeScript code can be converted into working JavaScript, the transpiler will output a JavaScript version of the file (**.js**).

TypeScript code is aÂ *super set* of JavaScript codeâ€”it has all the features of traditional JavaScript but adds some new features.

### **Type Inferences**

JavaScript allows us to assign any value to any variable. That makes it very flexible to use, which can be good for getting started quickly in coding. In practice, variables that are assigned values of multiple types throughout a program can be very confusing or lead to bugs.

One of the first things weâ€™ll discover with TypeScript is that when we declare a variable with an initial value, the variable can never be reassigned a value of a different data type. This is an example ofÂ *type inference*: everywhere in our program, TypeScript expects the data type of the variable to match the type of the value initially assigned to it at declaration.

### **Type Shapes**

Because TypeScript knows whatÂ *types*Â our objects are, it also knows whatÂ *shapes*Â our objects adhere to. An objectâ€™s shape describes, among other things, what properties and methods it does or doesnâ€™t contain.

The built-in types in JavaScript each have known properties and methods that always exist. AllÂ `string`s, for example, are known to have aÂ `.length`Â property andÂ `.toLowerCase()`method.

### **Review**

All right! Youâ€™ve taken some first steps into the wonderful world of type safety with TypeScript. ðŸ’ª

To recap, youâ€™ve learned:

- *TypeScript*Â is a superset of JavaScript that adds types.
- TheÂ *type system*Â refers to TypeScriptâ€™s understanding of how your code is meant to function: mainly what data types should be stored under your variables.
- TypeScript expects the data type of the variable to match the type of the value initially assigned to it at its declarationâ€”this is known asÂ *type inference*.
- An objectâ€™sÂ *shape*Â describes, among other things, what properties and methods it does or doesnâ€™t contain. TypeScript knows not only what type something is but also what shape that type has.
- When it isnâ€™t able to infer a type, TypeScript will consider a variable to be of typeÂ `any`.
- *Type annotations*Â are little pieces of code that indicate what type a variable is meant to be.

# **The tsconfig.json File**

**Letâ€™s explore what the tsconfig.json file is for.**

TypeScript features are extremely useful: for one, it allows us to add types to regular JavaScript code. It also checks for syntax errors even before run time. It even provides tooltips that show you why some code might throw an error. There are so many great features that come by default. Even with all these great features, TypeScript recognizes the need for flexibility.

Sometimes, you donâ€™t want all theÂ [default rules](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html)Â that TypeScript is trying to enforce â€” and thatâ€™s fine. Thatâ€™s one reason why providing aÂ **tsconfig.json**Â file is useful. Additionally, you get perks like telling the TypeScript compiler what files to run on and more! So, letâ€™s explore what this file looks like and how it helps.

### Typescript Functions

### **Review**

We learned all about how to use TypeScript to specify the types of function parameters and return types. Now we know how to:

- Give type annotations to function parameters.
- Deal with type annotations for optional parameters, which may have default values.
- Understand how TypeScript determines the return type of a function.
- Explicitly specify return types for functions, including for functions that donâ€™t return anything.
- Use the above skills to diagnose and fix bugs in our code.

Great job!

### Functions Arrays

Beautiful! Array types may seem like a monster topic, but now youâ€™ve got it tamed. You learned:

- The type annotations for arrays.
- What tuples are, and how to do their type annotations.
- How type inference works with arrays and tuples.
- How to use the rest and spread operators with TypeScript.

Arrays types are a crucial component of TypeScript, so great job!

### Custom types

### **Enums**

Our first example of a complex type is also one of the most useful:Â *enums*. We use enums when weâ€™d like toÂ **enum**erate all the possible values that a variable could have. This is in contrast to most of the other types we have studied. A variable of theÂ `string`Â type can have any string as a value; there are infinitely many possible strings, and it would be impossible to list them all. Similarly, a variable of theÂ `boolean[]`Â type can have any array of booleans as its value; again, the possibilities are infinite.

```tsx
enum Direction {
Â Â North,
Â Â South,
Â Â East,
Â Â West
}
```

### **Review**

Upon completion of this lesson you have officially* become a TypeScript Hero. No longer are you limited to TypeScriptâ€™s pre-defined types; you have now learned how to create your own custom types! These include:

- Enums (both string and numeric)
- Object types
- Function types

Furthermore, you learned how to refer to complex types using type aliases. And you even learned to master generics, which are like doubly-custom types. Impressive!

### **Union types**

TypeScript lets us type variables with different levels ofÂ *type specificity*. If we want to enforce that a variable is aÂ `string`, we can type it as aÂ `string`. This type is very specific since TypeScript will only allow the variable to have a string value.

On the other end of the specificity spectrum, we could type a variable asÂ `any`. This type is very unspecific. TypeScript will allow a value of any type to be assigned without complaining and throwing an error.

These two levels of type specificity work for many parts of our programs. However, sometimes we need to strike a balance between extreme specificity and being totally unspecific with our types. Imagine that we have to write a program that takes in an employeeâ€™s ID, then prints the ID to the console. The catch is that an employeeâ€™s ID could be a string or a number. Since we need our ID variable to allow more than one type, we could use anÂ `any`Â type, like this:

```tsx
let ID: any;

console.log(`The ID is ${ID}.`);

```

The problem with theÂ `any`Â type is that any value might not work with our program. To solve this problem, TypeScript allows us to be flexible with how specific our types are by combining different types. When we combine types, it is called aÂ *union*.

### **Review Unions**

ðŸ™Œ Way to go! Weâ€™ve learned a variety of ways to create types that are as specific as we need with unions. To recap, weâ€™ve learned:

- We can combine multiple types with a vertical bar characterÂ `|`. This is the syntax for defining aÂ *union*. Each type in a union is called aÂ *type member*.
- We can narrow down what methods and properties are available in a program withÂ *type narrowing*. Type narrowing allows us to type a variable as a union, then narrow down the union with aÂ *type guard*Â to call type member specific methods and properties.
- If a function can return multiple types, TypeScript will infer all possible return types as a union.
- We can use unions to allow arrays to have multiple types of values.
- To call a method or property on a variable typed as a union, we can only call methods or properties that are identical on all members of the union.
- We can define states within our program by using literal types and unions.

### **Type Narrowing**

When compiling TypeScript code to JavaScript, the compiler will throw any errors related to variable types. This process of compilation involves giving the TypeScript compiler the information it needs to perform type checks. Therefore, when we give our variables specific types, these types are reinforced by the compiler/TypeScript.

If TypeScript could only check types at compile-time, that would still be useful, but it turns out that TypeScript can do so much more. TypeScript has the ability to evaluate how our runtime code will perform, and then infer variable types for us. When the compiler notices an error, it will complain when runningÂ `tsc`Â and also by showing a red squiggly line below the code in the editor.

Evaluating runtime code can be really useful when our programs have variables of multiple types. In the case of unions, TypeScript can hone in on a more narrow type by evaluating our runtime code. For example:

```tsx
function formatDate(date: string | number) {
Â Â // date can be aÂ number or string here

Â Â if (typeof date === 'string') {
Â Â Â Â // date must be aÂ string here
Â Â }
}

```

In the example above, theÂ `date`Â parameter has a union type ofÂ `string | number`. Inside the body ofÂ `formatDate()`, thereâ€™s a conditional that checks ifÂ `date`Â is aÂ `'string'`. If the condition is met, then TypeScript can infer thatÂ `date`Â must be aÂ `string`type within the conditional. It will allow us to call methods and properties that are allowed onÂ `string`Â types. This is calledÂ *type narrowing*. Type narrowing is when TypeScript can infer more specific types based on the variableâ€™s surrounding code.

### **Review Type Narrowing**

Youâ€™re theÂ *type*Â of person that finishes lessons! Nice work on completing Type Narrowing. Youâ€™re now equipped to utilize TypeScriptâ€™s powers of inference through type guards and type narrowing. Letâ€™s review what we learned:

- TypeScript can understand how our code will execute at runtime so that it can infer more specific types while we write code. This is calledÂ *type narrowing*.
- An expression that checks if a variable is a specific type is called aÂ *type guard*. Type guardâ€™s allow TypeScript to recognize when it can type narrow.
- TheÂ `typeof`Â operator is useful when writing type guards. It can check if a variable is aÂ `'string'`,Â `'number'`,Â `'boolean'`, orÂ `'symbol'`.
- TheÂ `in`Â operator is useful for checking if a specific property exists on an object.Â `in`Â is especially helpful when we have data represented as objects.
- TypeScript can type narrow after a type guard with anÂ `else`block. TypeScript understands that theÂ `else`Â block of anÂ `if`Â statement must be the inverse condition of theÂ `if`statementâ€™s conditional.
- TypeScript can go even further and type narrow after a type guard if the type guard has aÂ `return`Â or another terminal statement within its block, noÂ `else`Â required.

**ADVANCED OBJECT TYPES**

### **Review**

ðŸ™Œ Way to go! You haveÂ *advanced*Â through this entire lesson. No one willÂ *object*Â to your superior TypeScript knowledge. Hereâ€™s an overview of what we learned:

- We can use bothÂ `interface`Â andÂ `type`Â keywords to declare types.
- `interface`Â is great for typing objects, especially within object-oriented programs.
- We can apply anÂ `interface`Â on aÂ `class`Â using theÂ `implements`Â keyword.
- Object types can be nested infinitely.
- We can define multiple types and compose them together to organize our code and make it more flexible.
- We can copy the type members of oneÂ `interface`Â into another using theÂ `extends`Â keyword.
- We can define variable property names within an object type with anÂ *index signature*. An index signature uses syntax like:Â `[propertyName: string]: string`.
- Itâ€™s possible to make some type members optional, using theÂ `?`Â operator. The syntax looks likeÂ `name?: string`.

Use the code editor to polish your understanding of typing objects in TypeScript.
