### Introduction to React Native

React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that allows developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It enables building apps for both iOS and Android platforms by offering a shared codebase, which significantly reduces development time and effort.

### What is React Native

React Native is a popular open-source framework developed by Facebook for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It enables developers to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase, which significantly speeds up development without compromising on the performance and usability of the apps.

With React Native, you write components with JSX, a syntax that combines JavaScript and XML. These components can map to native UI elements like views, text, images, and more.

### Why React Native?

React Native is a widely popular framework for building native mobile applications using JavaScript and React. There are plenty of reasons why you would want to choose React Native for your next mobile app development project:

- **Code Reusability:** React Native allows you to share a significant amount of your codebase between iOS and Android platforms. This not only reduces the development time but also makes it easier to maintain the app.
- **Familiar React Concepts:** If you’re already familiar with ReactJS, React Native will feel right at home for you. Since it’s based on React, the same principles of components and state management apply in React Native too.
- **Native Performance:** React Native apps deliver near-native performance as the framework works directly with native components like Views and Text, thus eliminating the need for WebView or other similar intermediaries.
- **Vast Ecosystem:** React Native enjoys a huge community and vast ecosystem that includes a wide range of libraries and tools that simplify and accelerate the development process. Additionally, Facebook and other major companies actively contribute to the growth and improvement of React Native.
- **Hot Reloading:** React Native supports hot-reloading, which means you can see the changes you make in your code directly on the device/emulator without having to recompile or rebuild the app entirely. This makes for a faster and more efficient development process

### ****React Native Alternatives****

React Native is a popular choice for cross-platform application development, but there are other options available. Some of the common alternatives to React Native are Flutter, Ionic and Xamarin. Flutter being the most popular alternative to React Native.

### Learn the Pre-requisites

Before you start learning React Native, you should have a basic knowledge of **[JavaScript](https://roadmap.sh/javascript)** and **[React](https://roadmap.sh/react)**. You don’t need to fully master these topics, but you should be familiar with them. Learn the basics of JavaScript (e.g. topics marked for beginners in **[JavaScript Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/javascript)** and continue with React Native. I have heard good things about official React Native documentation, so you can start there and pick up the relevant topics wherever needed.

### CSS Basics

CSS is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. It is primarily used for styling web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML. React native uses CSS to style its components. You can learn some CSS basics to get started with React Native and learn more as you go.
