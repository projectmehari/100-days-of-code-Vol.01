    ### Smart Contracts
    
    A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement.

    ### ERC Tokens
    
    An ‘Ethereum Request for Comments’ (ERC) is a document that programmers use to write smart contracts on Ethereum Blockchain. They describe rules in these documents that Ethereum-based tokens must comply with.
    While there are several Ethereum standards. These ERC Ethereum standards are the most well-known and popular: ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-777.

    ### Crypto Wallets
    
    A cryptocurrency wallet is a device, physical medium, program, or service which stores the public and/or private keys for cryptocurrency transactions. In addition to this basic function of storing the keys, a cryptocurrency wallet more often also offers the functionality of encrypting and/or signing information.

    Crypto wallets keep your private keys – the passwords that give you access to your cryptocurrencies – safe and accessible, allowing you to send and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They come in many forms, from hardware wallets like Ledger (which looks like a USB stick) to mobile apps like [Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/), which makes using crypto as easy as shopping with a credit card online.
    
    **Why are crypto wallets important?**
    
    Unlike a normal wallet, which can hold actual cash, crypto wallets technically don’t store your crypto. Your holdings live on the blockchain, but can only be accessed using a private key. Your keys prove your ownership of your digital money and allow you to make transactions. If you lose your private keys, you lose access to your money. That’s why it’s important to keep your hardware wallet safe, or use a trusted wallet provider like Coinbase.

    ### IDE’s
    
    An integrated development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.

    ### Crypto Faucets
    
    A crypto faucet lets users earn small crypto rewards by completing simple tasks. The metaphor is based on how even one drop of water from a leaky faucet could eventually fill up a cup. There are various kinds of crypto faucets, including bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and BNB faucets.
    Faucets are common in development environments where developers obtain testnet crypto in order develop and test their application prior to mainnet deployment.

    ### Decentralized Storage
    
    Decentralized storage is where data is stored on a decentralized network across multiple locations by users or groups who are incentivized to join, store, and keep data accessible. The servers used are hosted by people, rather than a single company. Anyone is free to join, they are kept honest due to smart contracts, and they are incentivized to participate via tokens.
